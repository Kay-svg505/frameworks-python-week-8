PMC,Development and Internal Validation of a Novel Model to Identify Inflammatory Biomarkers of a Response to Escitalopram in Patients With Major Depressive Disorder,"Objective: The aim of our study was to identify immune- and inflammation-related factors with clinical utility to predict the clinical efficacy of treatment for depression. Study Design: This was a follow-up study. Participants who met the entry criteria were administered with escitalopram (5–10 mg/day) as an initial treatment. Self-evaluation and observer valuations were arranged at the end of weeks 0, 4, 8, and 12, with blood samples collected at baseline and during weeks 2 and 12. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was then carried out by incorporating three cytokines selected by the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model. Internal validation was estimated using the bootstrap method with 1,000 repetitions. Results: A total of 85 patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), including 62 responders and 23 non-responders, were analyzed. Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), and lipocalin-2 were selected by the LASSO regression model. The area under the curve (AUC) from the logistic model was 0.811 and was confirmed as 0.7887 following bootstrapping validation. Conclusions: We established and validated a good prediction model to facilitate the individualized prediction of escitalopram treatment for MDD and created a personalized approach to treatment for patients with depression.",2021-05-20,"Zhou, Jingjing; Zhou, Jia; Sun, Zuoli; Feng, Lei; Zhu, Xuequan; Yang, Jian; Wang, Gang",Front Psychiatry

BioRxiv; WHO,Single domain shark VNAR antibodies neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro,"Single domain shark VNAR antibodies can offer a viable alternative to conventional Ig-based monoclonal antibodies in treating COVID-19 disease during the current pandemic. Here we report the identification of neutralizing single domain VNAR antibodies selected against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein derived from the Wuhan variant using phage display. We identified 56 unique binding clones that exhibited high affinity and specificity to the spike protein. Of those, 10 showed an ability to block both the spike protein receptor binding domain from the Wuhan variant and the N501Y mutant from interacting with recombinant ACE2 receptor in vitro. In addition, 3 antibody clones retained in vitro blocking activity when the E484K spike protein mutant was used. The inhibitory property of the VNAR antibodies was further confirmed for all 10 antibody clones using ACE2 expressing cells with spike protein from the Wuhan variant. The viral neutralizing potential of the VNAR clones was also confirmed for the 10 antibodies tested using live Wuhan variant virus in in vitro cell infectivity assays. Single domain VNAR antibodies due to their low complexity, small size, unique epitope recognition and formatting flexibility should be a useful adjunct to existing antibody approaches to treat COVID-19.",2021-06-08,"Gauhar, Aziz; Privezentzev, Cyril V; Demydchuk, Mykhaylo; Gerlza, Tanja; Rieger, Julia; Kungl, Andreas J; Walsh, Frank S; Lynn Rutkowski, J; Stocki, Pawel",bioRxiv

WHO,Point-of-care ultrasound during the COVID-19 pandemic: A multidisciplinary approach between intensivists and echocardiographers,"PURPOSE: The coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) led to a large influx of critically ill patients and altered echocardiography laboratory workflow. We developed a point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) first approach to patients requiring echocardiography and describe our workflow and findings. METHODS: We performed a single-center retrospective analysis of all POCUS studies performed on critically ill patients with COVID-19. Sonography was performed by intensivists, uploaded and archived, and rapidly reviewed by echocardiographers. We evaluated each study based on the number of views obtained. Additionally, we provide a description of the workflow during the COVID-19 surge at a tertiary care hospital in New York City. RESULTS: Fifty patients had POCUS studies performed by intensivists and reviewed by echocardiographers obviating the need for sonographer-performed studies. Of the 48 cardiac POCUS studies, 17% of patients had 4 of 4 standard views available while 53% had 3 of 4 standard views. The parasternal long-axis view was obtained on 81%, subxiphoid view on 79%, apical 4-chamber view on 71%, and parasternal short-axis view on 63% of patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our POCUS workflow allowed intensivists to perform cardiac sonography for rapid bedside diagnosis of pathology with immediate interpretation performed by echocardiographers. At least 3 views were obtained in the majority of cases.",2021,"Yuriditsky, Eugene; Saric, Muhamed; Horowitz, James M",Echocardiography
PMC; WHO,"Joint Predictive Value of cTnI and NT-proBNP on Mortality in Patients with Coronavirus Disease 2019: A Retrospective Research in Wuhan, China","BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) remains to be the biggest public threat all over the world. Because of the rapid deterioration in some patients, markers that could predict poor clinical outcomes are urgently required. This study was to evaluate the predictive values of cardiac injury parameters, including cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) levels, on mortality in COVID-19 patients. METHODS: COVID-19 patients in Zhongfaxincheng branch of Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China) from February 8–28, 2020, were enrolled in this study. We followed up the patients for 30 days after admission. RESULTS: A total of 134 patients were included in the study. Multivariate Cox regression showed that 1) patients with elevated cTnI levels had a higher risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] 7.33, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.56–21.00) than patients with normal cTnI levels; 2) patients with elevated NT-proBNP levels had a higher risk of death (HR 27.88, 95% CI 3.55–218.78) than patients with normal NT-proBNP levels; 3) patients with both elevated cTnI and NT-proBNP levels had a significantly higher risk of death (HR 53.87, 95% CI 6.31–459.91, P < 0.001) compared to patients without elevated cTnI or NT-proBNP levels; 4) the progressions of cTnI and NT-proBNP levels were also correlated with death (HR 12.70, 95% CI 3.94–40.88, P < 0.001 and HR 51.09, 95% CI 5.82–448.26, P < 0.001).

Medline,"Glass hybrid (glass ionomer) versus composite for non-carious cervical lesions: Survival, restoration quality and costs in randomized controlled trial after 3 years.","OBJECTIVE This study compared survival, restoration quality and costs of glass hybrid (GH; EQUIA Forte Fil/EQUIA Forte Coat) and resin composite restorations (RC; OptiBond FL/Filtek Supreme XTE) of sclerotic non-carious cervical lesions. METHODS This is a cluster-randomized trial (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02631161). 88 patients (50-70 years) with 175 sNCCLs were randomized to receive GH or RC. Restorations were placed without mechanical cavity preparation and followed for a mean 36 (min/max: 31/55) months (variable follow-up due to COVID-19 lockdown). Restoration quality was re-evaluated at 1-, 18- and 36-months using FDI-criteria. Survival was assessed using multi-level Cox-regression analysis. Costs were estimated from a payer's perspective in Germany. Initial costs were determined based on micro-costing using time recordings and hourly costs, and follow-up costs based on statutory insurance fee-item-catalogues. RESULTS 88 patients (175 restorations) were treated; 43 received GH (83 restorations), 45 RC (92 restorations). 17 GH and 19 RC showed total retention loss, 5 GH were partially lost (p = 0.396/Cox). FDI ratings were not sufficiently different for any domain except surface luster, where RC showed higher score (p < 0.001). Costs were initially lower for GH (32.57; SD 16.36 €) than RC (44.25; SD 21.40), while re-treatment costs were similar (GH: 9.15; SD 15.70 €; RC: 7.35; SD 14.51 €), resulting in significantly lower costs for GH (GH: 41.72; SD 25.08 €) than RC (51.6; 26.17 €) (p < 0.001/GLM). CONCLUSIONS While survival was not significantly different, GH was significantly less costly both initially and long-term than RC for restoring non-carious cervical lesions. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Within this trial, survival was not significantly different between GH and RC to restore sclerotic NCCLs. As GH was significantly less costly both initially and long-term than RC, using RC was only cost-effective for payers willing to invest high additional expenses per minimal survival gains.",2021-05-09,"Schwendicke, Falk; Müller, Anne; Seifert, Tilmann; Jeggle-Engbert, Linda-Maria; Paris, Sebastian; Göstemeyer, Gerd",Journal of dentistry
WHO,Screening of immune-related differentially expressed genes from primary lymphatic organs of broilers fed with probiotic bacillus cereus PAS38 based on suppression subtractive hybridization,"To explore the molecular mechanism of the effect of Bacillus cereus PAS38 on the immunity of broilers, sixty 7-day-old broilers were divided into two groups with three replicates. The control group was fed with basal diet, and the treatment group was fed with basal diet containing Bacillus cereus PAS38 1×106 CFU/g. Thymus and bursa of fabricius were taken from two groups of broilers at the age of 42 days, total RNA was extracted, differential gene library was constructed by SSH technology, and immune-related differential genes were screened. Then, we used siRNA to interfere with the expression of some differential genes in the original generation lymphocytes of broiler blood to detect the change of cytokines mRNA expression level. A total of 42 immune-related differentially expressed genes were screened, including 22 up-regulated genes and 20 down-regulated genes. When 7 differentially up-regulated genes associated with enhanced immune function were interfered with in lymphocytes, some immune-promoting cytokines were down-regulated. These results showed that Bacillus cereus PAS38 might up-regulate the expression of JCHAIN, PRDX1, CD3E, CDK6 and other genes in immune organs of broilers, thereby affecting the development of immune organs, the expression of various cytokines and the transduction of immune signals, improving the immune capacity of broilers.",2020,"Li, Jiajun; Li, Wanqiang; Wang, Zhenhua; Khalique, Abdul; Wang, Junrui; Yang, Miao; Ni, Xueqin; Zeng, Dong; Zhang, Dongmei; Zeng, Yan; Luo, Qihui; Jing, Bo; Pan, Kangcheng",PLoS One
Medline,Monoclonal antibody-based antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reveals high sensitivity of the nucleocapsid protein in acute-phase sera of severe acute respiratory syndrome patients.,"Accurate and timely diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection is a critical step in preventing another global outbreak. In this study, 829 serum specimens were collected from 643 patients initially reported to be infected with SARS-CoV. The sera were tested for the N protein of SARS-CoV by using an antigen capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) based on monoclonal antibodies against the N protein of SARS-CoV and compared to 197 control serum samples from healthy donors and non-SARS febrile patients. The results of the N protein detection analysis were directly related to the serological analysis data. From 27 SARS patients who tested positive with the neutralization test, 100% of the 24 sera collected from 1 to 10 days after the onset of symptoms were positive for the N protein. N protein was not detected beyond day 11 in this group. The positive rates of N protein for sera collected at 1 to 5, 6 to 10, 11 to 15, and 16 to 20 days after the onset of symptoms for 414 samples from 298 serologically confirmed patients were 92.9, 69.8, 36.4, and 21.1%, respectively. For 294 sera from 248 serological test-negative patients, the rates were 25.6, 16.7, 9.3, and 0%, respectively. The N protein was not detected in 66 patients with cases of what was initially suspected to be SARS but serologically proven to be negative for SARS and in 197 serum samples from healthy donors and non-SARS febrile patients. The specificity of the assay was 100%. Furthermore, of 16 sera collected from four patients during the SARS recurrence in Guangzhou, 5 sera collected from 7 to 9 days after the onset of symptoms were positive for the N protein. N protein detection exhibited a high positive rate, 96 to 100%, between day 3 and day 5 after the onset of symptoms for 27 neutralization test-positive SARS patients and 298 serologically confirmed patients. The N protein detection rate continually decreased beginning with day 10, and N protein was not detected beyond day 19 after the onset of symptoms. In conclusion, an antigen capture ELISA reveals a high N protein detection rate in acute-phase sera of patients with SARS, which makes it useful for early diagnosis of SARS.",2005,"Di, Biao; Hao, Wei; Gao, Yang; Wang, Ming; Wang, Ya-di; Qiu, Li-wen; Wen, Kun; Zhou, Duan-hua; Wu, Xin-wei; Lu, En-jie; Liao, Zhi-yong; Mei, Ya-bo; Zheng, Bo-jian; Che, Xiao-yan",Clinical and diagnostic laboratory immunology

Medline,A novel biomarker-based prognostic score in acute ischemic stroke: The CoRisk score.,"OBJECTIVES To derive and externally validate a copeptin-based parsimonious score to predict unfavorable outcome 3 months after an acute ischemic stroke (AIS). METHODS The derivation cohort consisted of patients with AIS enrolled prospectively at the University Hospital Basel, Switzerland. The validation cohort was prospectively enrolled after the derivation cohort at the University Hospital of Bern and University Hospital Basel, Switzerland, as well as Frankfurt a.M., Germany. The score components were copeptin levels, age, NIH Stroke Scale, and recanalization therapy (CoRisk score). Copeptin levels were measured in plasma drawn within 24 hours of AIS and before any recanalization therapy. The primary outcome of disability and death at 3 months was defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 3 to 6. RESULTS Overall, 1,102 patients were included in the analysis; the derivation cohort contributed 319 patients, and the validation cohort contributed 783. An unfavorable outcome was observed among 436 patients (40%). For the 3-month prediction of disability and death, the CoRisk score was well calibrated in the validation cohort, for which the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.819 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.787-0.849). The calibrated CoRisk score correctly classified 75% of patients (95% CI 72-78). The net reclassification index between the calibrated CoRisk scores with and without copeptin was 46% (95% CI 32-60). CONCLUSIONS The biomarker-based CoRisk score for the prediction of disability and death was externally validated, was well calibrated, and performed better than the same score without copeptin.

Medline; PMC,High-Throughput Plant Phenotyping Platform (HT3P) as a Novel Tool for Estimating Agronomic Traits From the Lab to the Field,"Food scarcity, population growth, and global climate change have propelled crop yield growth driven by high-throughput phenotyping into the era of big data. However, access to large-scale phenotypic data has now become a critical barrier that phenomics urgently must overcome. Fortunately, the high-throughput plant phenotyping platform (HT3P), employing advanced sensors and data collection systems, can take full advantage of non-destructive and high-throughput methods to monitor, quantify, and evaluate specific phenotypes for large-scale agricultural experiments, and it can effectively perform phenotypic tasks that traditional phenotyping could not do. In this way, HT3Ps are novel and powerful tools, for which various commercial, customized, and even self-developed ones have been recently introduced in rising numbers. Here, we review these HT3Ps in nearly 7 years from greenhouses and growth chambers to the field, and from ground-based proximal phenotyping to aerial large-scale remote sensing. Platform configurations, novelties, operating modes, current developments, as well the strengths and weaknesses of diverse types of HT3Ps are thoroughly and clearly described. Then, miscellaneous combinations of HT3Ps for comparative validation and comprehensive analysis are systematically present, for the first time. Finally, we consider current phenotypic challenges and provide fresh perspectives on future development trends of HT3Ps. This review aims to provide ideas, thoughts, and insights for the optimal selection, exploitation, and utilization of HT3Ps, and thereby pave the way to break through current phenotyping bottlenecks in botany.",2021-01-13,"Li, Daoliang; Quan, Chaoqun; Song, Zhaoyang; Li, Xiang; Yu, Guanghui; Li, Cheng; Muhammad, Akhter",Front Bioeng Biotechnol
PMC,The impact of commodity price volatility on fiscal balance and the role of real interest rate,"The objective of this study is to explore the impact of commodity price volatility on the governments’ fiscal balance. Using a dynamic panel data model for 108 countries from 1993 to 2018, this study finds that governments’ fiscal balance deteriorates with commodity price volatility, especially for commodity-exporting economies. A one standard deviation increase in commodity price volatility leads to a reduction of approximately 0.04 units in the fiscal balance as a percentage of gross domestic product. Further, we examine the role of real interest rates in influencing the relationship between commodity price volatility and fiscal balance. The empirical results suggest that the negative impact of commodity price volatility on fiscal balance can be mitigated with a lower real interest rate. This implies under the sticky price assumption, an accommodative monetary policy could be effective in moderating the negative effect of commodity price volatility on fiscal balance.",2022-01-11,"Majumder, Monoj Kumar; Raghavan, Mala; Vespignani, Joaquin",Empir Econ
MedRxiv; WHO,SARS-CoV-2 Transmission Risk from sports Equipment (STRIKE),"OBJECTIVES: To investigate the potential of shared sporting equipment as transmission vectors of SARS-CoV-2 during the reintroduction of sports such as soccer, rugby, cricket, tennis, golf and gymnastics. SETTING: Laboratory based live SARS-CoV-2 virus study. INTERVENTIONS: Ten different types of sporting equipment were inoculated with 40l droplets containing clinically relevant high and low concentrations of live SARS-CoV-2 virus. Materials were then swabbed at time points relevant to sports (1, 5, 15, 30, 90 minutes). The amount of live SARS-CoV-2 recovered at each time point was enumerated using viral plaque assays, and viral decay and half-life was estimated through fitting linear models to log transformed data from each material. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The primary outcome measure was quantification of retrievable SARS-CoV-2 virus from each piece of equipment at pre-determined time points. RESULTS: At one minute, SARS-CoV-2 virus was recovered in only seven of the ten types of equipment with the low dose inoculum, one at five minutes and none at 15 minutes. Retrievable virus dropped significantly for all materials tested using the high dose inoculum with mean recovery of virus falling to 0.74% at 1 minute, 0.39% at 15 minutes and 0.003% at 90 minutes. Viral recovery, predicted decay, and half-life varied between materials with porous surfaces limiting virus transmission. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that there is an exponential reduction in SARS-CoV-2 recoverable from a range of sports equipment after a short time period, and virus is less transferrable from materials such as a tennis ball, red cricket ball and cricket glove. Given this rapid loss of viral load and the fact that transmission requires a significant inoculum to be transferred from equipment to the mucous membranes of another individual it seems unlikely that sports equipment is a major cause for transmission of SARS-CoV-2. These findings have important policy implications in the context of the pandemic and may promote other infection control measures in sports to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and urge sports equipment manufacturers to identify surfaces that may or may not be likely to retain transferable virus.",2021-02-08,"Edwards, T.; Kay, G.

Medline; PMC,Plasma ACE2 predicts outcome of COVID-19 in hospitalized patients,"AIMS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) binds to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) enabling entrance of the virus into cells and causing the infection termed coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19). Here, we investigate associations between plasma ACE2 and outcome of COVID-19. METHODS AND RESULTS: This analysis used data from a large longitudinal study of 306 COVID-19 positive patients and 78 COVID-19 negative patients (MGH Emergency Department COVID-19 Cohort). Comprehensive clinical data were collected on this cohort, including 28-day outcomes. The samples were run on the Olink® Explore 1536 platform which includes measurement of the ACE2 protein. High admission plasma ACE2 in COVID-19 patients was associated with increased maximal illness severity within 28 days with OR = 1.8, 95%-CI: 1.4–2.3 (P < 0.0001). Plasma ACE2 was significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with hypertension compared with patients without hypertension (P = 0.0045). Circulating ACE2 was also significantly higher in COVID-19 patients with pre-existing heart conditions and kidney disease compared with patients without these pre-existing conditions (P = 0.0363 and P = 0.0303, respectively). CONCLUSION: This study suggests that measuring plasma ACE2 is potentially valuable in predicting COVID-19 outcomes.

Medline; PMC; WHO,Versatile SARS-CoV-2 Reverse-Genetics Systems for the Study of Antiviral Resistance and Replication,"The COVID-19 pandemic continues to threaten healthcare systems worldwide due to the limited access to vaccines, suboptimal treatment options, and the continuous emergence of new and more transmissible SARS-CoV-2 variants. Reverse-genetics studies of viral genes and mutations have proven highly valuable in advancing basic virus research, leading to the development of therapeutics. We developed a functional and highly versatile full-length SARS-CoV-2 infectious system by cloning the sequence of a COVID-19 associated virus isolate (DK-AHH1) into a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC). Viruses recovered after RNA-transfection of in vitro transcripts into Vero E6 cells showed growth kinetics and remdesivir susceptibility similar to the DK-AHH1 virus isolate. Insertion of reporter genes, green fluorescent protein, and nanoluciferase into the ORF7 genomic region led to high levels of reporter activity, which facilitated high throughput treatment experiments. We found that putative coronavirus remdesivir resistance-associated substitutions F480L and V570L—and naturally found polymorphisms A97V, P323L, and N491S, all in nsp12—did not decrease SARS-CoV-2 susceptibility to remdesivir. A nanoluciferase reporter clone with deletion of spike (S), envelope (E), and membrane (M) proteins exhibited high levels of transient replication, was inhibited by remdesivir, and therefore could function as an efficient non-infectious subgenomic replicon system. The developed SARS-CoV-2 reverse-genetics systems, including recombinants to modify infectious viruses and non-infectious subgenomic replicons with autonomous genomic RNA replication, will permit high-throughput cell culture studies—providing fundamental understanding of basic biology of this coronavirus. We have proven the utility of the systems in rapidly introducing mutations in nsp12 and studying their effect on the efficacy of remdesivir, which is used worldwide for the treatment of COVID-19. Our system provides a platform to effectively test the antiviral activity of drugs and the phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 mutants.",2022-01-18,"Fahnøe, Ulrik; Pham, Long V.; Fernandez-Antunez, Carlota; Costa, Rui; Rivera-Rangel, Lizandro René; Galli, Andrea; Feng, Shan; Mikkelsen, Lotte S.; Gottwein, Judith M.; Scheel, Troels K.

Medline,Pediatric Acute Lung Injury Epidemiology and Natural History study: Incidence and outcome of the acute respiratory distress syndrome in children.,"OBJECTIVES The incidence and outcome of the acute respiratory distress syndrome in children are not well-known, especially under current ventilatory practices. The goal of this study was to determine the incidence, etiology, and outcome of acute respiratory distress syndrome in the pediatric population in the setting of lung protective ventilation. DESIGN A 1-yr, prospective, multicenter, observational study in 12 geographical areas of Spain (serving a population of 3.77 million ≤ 15 yrs of age) covered by 21 pediatric intensive care units. SUBJECTS All consecutive pediatric patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation and meeting American-European Consensus Criteria for acute respiratory distress syndrome. INTERVENTIONS None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Data on ventilatory management, gas exchange, hemodynamics, and organ dysfunction were collected. A total of 146 mechanically ventilated patients fulfilled the acute respiratory distress syndrome definition, representing a incidence of 3.9/100,000 population ≤ 15 yrs of age/yr. Pneumonia and sepsis were the most common causes of acute respiratory distress syndrome. At the time of meeting acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria, mean PaO2/FIO2 was 99 mm Hg ± 41 mm Hg, mean tidal volume was 7.6 mL/kg ± 1.8 mL/kg predicted body weight, mean plateau pressure was 27 cm H2O ± 6 cm H2O, and mean positive end-expiratory pressure was 8.9 cm ± 2.9 cm H2O. Overall pediatric intensive care unit and hospital mortality were 26% (95% confidence interval 19.6-33.7) and 27.4% (95% confidence interval 20.8-35.1), respectively. At 24 hrs, after the assessment of oxygenation under standard ventilatory settings, 118 (80.8%) patients continued to meet acute respiratory distress syndrome criteria (PaO2/FIO2 104 mm Hg ± 36 mm Hg; pediatric intensive care units mortality 30.5%), whereas 28 patients (19.2%) had a PaO2/FIO2 >200 mm Hg (pediatric intensive care units mortality 7.1%) (p = .014). CONCLUSIONS This is the largest study to estimate prospectively the pediatric population-based acute respiratory distress syndrome incidence and the first incidence study performed during the routine application of lung protective ventilation in children. Our findings support a lower acute respiratory distress syndrome incidence and mortality than those reported for adults. PaO2/FIO2 ratios at acute respiratory distress syndrome onset and at 24 hrs after onset were helpful in defining groups at greater risk of dying (clinical trials registered with http://www.clinicaltrials.gov; NCT 01142544).",2012,"López-Fernández, Yolanda; Azagra, Amelia Martínez-de; de la Oliva, Pedro; Modesto, Vicent; Sánchez, Juan I; Parrilla, Julio; Arroyo, María José; Reyes, Susana Beatriz; Pons-Ódena, Martí; López-Herce, Jesús; Fernández, Rosa Lidia; Kacmarek, Robert M; Villar, Jesús",Critical care medicine
Medline,Pediatric Percutaneous Osteoid Osteoma Ablation: Cone-Beam CT with Fluoroscopic Overlay Versus Conventional CT Guidance.,"PURPOSE To compare technical success, clinical success, complications, radiation dose, and total room utilization time for osteoid osteoma thermal (radiofrequency or microwave) ablation using cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) with two-axis fluoroscopic navigational overlay versus conventional computed tomography (CT) guidance. MATERIALS AND METHODS A retrospective review was performed to identify all osteoid osteoma ablations performed over a 5.5-year period at a single tertiary care pediatric hospital. Twenty-five ablations (15 radiofrequency and 10 microwave) in 23 patients undergoing fluoroscopic CBCT-guided osteoid osteoma ablation were compared to 35 ablations (35 radiofrequency) in 32 patients undergoing ablation via conventional CT guidance. Dose area product and dose length product were recorded for CBCT and conventional CT, respectively, and converted to effective doses. Technical success, clinical success (cessation of pain and medication use 1 month after ablation), complications, radiation dose, and total room utilization time were compared. RESULTS All procedures were technically successful. Twenty-two of 25 (88.0%) CBCT and 31 of 35 (88.6%) conventional CT-guided ablations achieved immediate clinical success. There were two minor complications in each group and no major complications. Mean effective radiation dose was significantly lower for CBCT compared to CT guidance (0.12 vs. 0.39 mSv, p = 0.02). Mean total room utilization time for CBCT was longer (133.5 vs. 97.5 min, p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS Fluoroscopic CBCT guidance for percutaneous osteoid osteoma ablation yields similar technical and clinical success, reduced radiation dose, and increased total room utilization time compared to conventional CT guidance.",2017,"Perry, Brandon C; Monroe, Eric J; McKay, Tyler; Kanal, Kalpana M; Shivaram, Giridhar",Cardiovascular and interventional radiology

PMC,Datenplattformökosysteme,"Platform ecosystems have become a source of sustained competitive advantages over pipeline models. A platform consists of a platform core (such as a smartphone operating system, a marketplace or a music streaming service) which is controlled by the platform owner who orchestrates the relationship between customers and providers (e.g. the distribution of goods, apps or music to end-users). Recently, the utilization and monetization of data has been significantly increasing. While some sources report the existence of data platforms as technical repositories to distribute data, the literature is sparse in discussing the role of data in platform ecosystems or outlining the existence of data platform ecosystems. By combining the technical concept of a data platform with the one of a platform ecosystem, a data platform ecosystem emerges. It comprises a platform ecosystem that facilitates the recombination and exchange of data around a stable core between a wide range of complements of data providers and prospective customers. To understand the characteristics of data platform ecosystems, we will elaborate on the concepts of data modularity, data quality, disposal and usage rights of data as well as ways to address the information paradox inherent to data. Based on these key properties, we illustrate the emergence of data platform ecosystems through two case examples and suggest avenues for future research.",2021-03-29,"Kramberg, Philipp; Heinzl, Armin",HMD
WHO,Detection of SARS-CoV-2 in respiratory samples from cats in the UK associated with human-to-cat transmission,"OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to find evidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in UK cats. DESIGN: Tissue samples were tested for SARS-CoV-2 antigen using immunofluorescence and for viral RNA by in situ hybridisation. A set of 387 oropharyngeal swabs that had been submitted for routine respiratory pathogen testing was tested for SARS-CoV-2 RNA using reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR. RESULTS: Lung tissue collected post-mortem from cat 1 tested positive for both SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antigen and RNA. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in an oropharyngeal swab collected from cat 2 that presented with rhinitis and conjunctivitis. High throughput sequencing of the viral genome revealed five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) compared to the nearest UK human SARS-CoV-2 sequence, and this human virus contained eight SNPs compared to the original Wuhan-Hu-1 reference sequence. An analysis of the viral genome of cat 2 together with nine other feline-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequences from around the world revealed no shared cat-specific mutations. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that human-to-cat transmission of SARS-CoV-2 occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, with the infected cats developing mild or severe respiratory disease. Given the ability of the new coronavirus to infect different species, it will be important to monitor for human-to-cat, cat-to-cat and cat-to-human transmission.",2021,"Hosie, Margaret J; Epifano, Ilaria; Herder, Vanessa; Orton, Richard J; Stevenson, Andrew; Johnson, Natasha; MacDonald, Emma; Dunbar, Dawn; McDonald, Michael; Howie, Fiona; Tennant, Bryn; Herrity, Darcy; Da Silva Filipe, Ana; Streicker, Daniel G; Willett, Brian J; Murcia, Pablo R; Jarrett, Ruth F; Robertson, David L; Weir, William",Vet Rec

ArXiv,Epidemic processes with vaccination and immunity loss studied with the BLUES function method,"The Beyond-Linear-Use-of-Equation-Superposition (BLUES) function method is extended to coupled nonlinear ordinary differential equations and applied to the epidemiological SIRS model with vaccination. Accurate analytic approximations are obtained for the time evolution of the susceptible and infected population fractions. The results are compared with those obtained with alternative methods, notably Adomian decomposition, variational iteration and homotopy perturbation. In contrast with these methods, the BLUES iteration converges rapidly, globally, and captures the exact asymptotic behavior for long times. The time of the infection peak is calculated using the BLUES approximants and the results are compared with numerical solutions, which indicate that the method is able to generate useful analytic expressions that coincide with the (numerically) exact ones already for a small number of iterations.",2021-06-30,"Berx, Jonas; Indekeu, Joseph O",

The fourth industrial revolution known as Industry 4.0 includes digitization, the Internet of Things, and artificial intelligence. Industry 4.0 has the potential to fulfil customized requirements during the COVID-19 emergency crises. The development of a prediction framework can help health authorities to react appropriately and rapidly. Clinical imaging like X-rays and computed tomography (CT) can play a significant part in the early diagnosis of COVID-19 patients that will help with appropriate treatment. The X-ray images could help in developing an automated system for the rapid identification of COVID-19 patients. This study makes use of a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract significant features and discriminate X-ray images of infected patients from non-infected ones. Multiple image processing techniques are used to extract a region of interest (ROI) from the entire X-ray image. The ImageDataGenerator class is used to overcome the small dataset size and generate ten thousand augmented images. The performance of the proposed approach has been compared with state-of-the-art VGG16, AlexNet, and InceptionV3 models. Results demonstrate that the proposed CNN model outperforms other baseline models with high accuracy values: 97.68% for two classes, 89.85% for three classes, and 84.76% for four classes.

Elsevier; Medline; PMC; WHO,Immunogenicity of the BNT162b2 COVID-19 mRNA vaccine and early clinical outcomes in patients with haematological malignancies in Lithuania: a national prospective cohort study,"BACKGROUND: Haematological malignancies and their treatments are likely to affect SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy. We aimed to evaluate serological response to BNT162b2 vaccine in patients with haematological malignancies by type of treatment. METHODS: Our national prospective cohort study was done in Lithuania and assessed serological response to one and two BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine doses in healthy health-care workers and in patients with haematological malignancies. Eligible participants were aged 18 years or older, had received both vaccine doses, and had available biobanked blood samples from before vaccination and after the second dose. Biobanked samples and health data were obtained from Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos Biobank. Abbott Architect SARS-CoV-2 IgG Quant II chemiluminescent microparticle assay was used to quantify serum anti-SARS-CoV-2-S1 IgG antibody (anti-S1 IgG antibody) concentrations 0–10 days before the first BNT162b2 vaccine, on the day of second immunisation (around day 21), and 7 to 21 days after the second immunisation. Adverse events were assessed by a standardised questionnaire. Breakthrough infections were characterised clinically and by SARS-CoV-2 genotyping whenever possible. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04871165. FINDINGS: Between Jan 8 and April 21, 2021, 885 participants with haematological malignancies were included in the study. 857 patients were anti-S1 IgG seronegative at timepoint 0 and constituted the main analysis cohort. The age-matched comparison was made between 315 patients with haematological malignancies who were aged 18–60 years and 67 healthy health-care workers in the same age group. Patients aged 18–60 years with haematological malignancies had lower median anti-S1 IgG antibody responses after two BNT162b2 vaccine doses than did health-care workers of the same age group (median 6961 AU/mL [IQR 1292–20 672] vs 21 395 AU/mL [14 831–33 553]; p<0·0001). Compared with untreated patients with haematological malignancies (n=53; median 5761 AU/mL [629–16 141]), patients actively treated with Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors (BTKIs; n=44; 0 AU/mL [0–7]; p<0·0001), ruxolitinib (n=16; 10 AU/mL [0–45]; p<0·0001), venetoclax (n=10; 4 AU/mL [0–1218]; p=0·0005), or anti-CD20 antibody therapy (n=87; 17 AU/mL [1–2319]; p<0·0001) showed particularly poor anti-S1 IgG antibody responses following two BNT162b2 doses. Patients being treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors (n=41; 10 537 AU/mL [IQR 2335–19 388]) or patients who received autologous haematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT; n=192; 6203 AU/mL [1451–16 834]) or allogeneic HSCT (n=122; 6304 AU/mL [1120–16 913]) were among the subgroups with the highest numerical responses. Nine SARS-CoV-2 infections and three COVID-19 deaths were observed among fully vaccinated patients with haematological malignancies. INTERPRETATION: Patients with haematological malignancies mount blunted and heterogeneous antibody responses to the full course of BNT162b2 mRNA vaccination. Patients who are actively treated with BTKIs, ruxolitinib, venetoclax, or anti-CD20 antibody therapies seem to be the most negatively affected and might be left unprotected from SARS-CoV-2 infection. Breakthrough severe SARS-CoV-2 infections in fully vaccinated patients with haematological malignancies emphasise the importance of ongoing strict adherence to non-pharmacological interventions and household vaccination while SARS-CoV-2 is circulating in the community.

WHO,Association of ABO blood group type with cardiovascular events in COVID-19,"Cardiovascular complications have been reported in patients with COVID-19. We sought to examine the association of ABO blood group type with cardiovascular complications in COVID-19. We examined 409 individuals enrolled in the COVID-19 Registry to Assess Frequency, Management, and Outcomes of Arterial and Venous Thromboembolic Complications (CORONA-VTE) who had ABO blood group data available. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the association of ABO blood group types with three primary outcomes: major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), major arterial and venous thrombosis and all-cause mortality. 201, 121, 61 and 26 individuals had blood group O, A, B and AB, respectively. In multivariable analysis, blood group A was associated with a 2.5-fold higher odds of MACE than blood group O (OR 2.47[1.18-5.18]). There was an effect suggesting a 2-fold higher odds of major thrombotic events in blood group A vs. O that did not reach statistical significance (OR 2.15 [0.89-5.20]). No association between blood group type and all-cause mortality was found. Compared with the other blood group types, blood group A was associated with an increased odds of MACE(ORA/non-A 2.18[1.11-4.29]), while blood group O was associated with lower odds of MACE(ORO/non-O 0.50[0.26-0.97]). In conclusion, blood group A was associated with an increased odds of MACE, whereas blood group O was associated with a reduction in the odds of MACE in patients with COVID-19. These findings may inform risk stratification of COVID-19 patients for cardiovascular complications.

However, due to the restrictions brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, the rehabilitation of patients with pelvic sarcomas was affected. Limited information is also presented in the literature regarding the rehabilitation of patients with lower extremity surgeries undergoing telerehabilitation and during a pandemic. This study presents the rehabilitation process of a 43-year-old woman diagnosed with pelvic round cell sarcoma of the right gluteal area during the COVID-19 pandemic. The patient underwent wide excision, buttockectomy and internal hemipelvectomy, and we measured outcomes using the Tinetti assessment tool (TAT) and Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS). A decreased risk of falls and improved functional performance were recorded using the TAT and LEFS respectively. Telerehabilitation was noted to have a good satisfaction rate among the patient and health workers.

WHO,Persistence of Bacteriophage Phi 6 on Porous and Nonporous Surfaces and the Potential for Its Use as an Ebola Virus or Coronavirus Surrogate,"The infection of health care workers during the 2013 to 2016 Ebola outbreak raised concerns about fomite transmission. In the wake of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, investigations are ongoing to determine the role of fomites in coronavirus transmission as well. The bacteriophage phi 6 has a phospholipid envelope and is commonly used in environmental studies as a surrogate for human enveloped viruses. The persistence of phi 6 was evaluated as a surrogate for Ebola virus (EBOV) and coronaviruses on porous and nonporous hospital surfaces. Phi 6 was suspended in a body fluid simulant and inoculated onto 1-cm2 coupons of steel, plastic, and two fabric curtain types. The coupons were placed at two controlled absolute humidity (AH) levels: a low AH of 3.0 g/m3 and a high AH of 14.4 g/m3 Phi 6 declined at a lower rate on all materials under low-AH conditions, with a decay rate of 0.06-log10 PFU/day to 0.11-log10 PFU/day, than under the higher AH conditions, with a decay rate of 0.65-log10 PFU/h to 1.42-log10 PFU/day. There was a significant difference in decay rates between porous and nonporous surfaces at both low AH (P < 0.0001) and high AH (P < 0.0001). Under these laboratory-simulated conditions, phi 6 was found to be a conservative surrogate for EBOV under low-AH conditions in that it persisted longer than Ebola virus in similar AH conditions. Additionally, some coronaviruses persist longer than phi 6 under similar conditions; therefore, phi 6 may not be a suitable surrogate for coronaviruses.IMPORTANCE Understanding the persistence of enveloped viruses helps inform infection control practices and procedures in health care facilities and community settings. These data convey to public health investigators that enveloped viruses can persist and remain infective on surfaces, thus demonstrating a potential risk for transmission. Under these laboratory-simulated Western indoor hospital conditions, we assessed the suitability of phi 6 as a surrogate for environmental persistence research related to enveloped viruses, including EBOV and coronaviruses.",2020,"Whitworth, Carrie; Mu, Yi; Houston, Hollis; Martinez-Smith, Marla; Noble-Wang, Judith; Coulliette-Salmond, Angela; Rose, Laura",
WHO,Make this tango viral: Touching toward the untouchable in tele- synaesthesia performance,"The COVID-19 pandemic has created an uncanny rift between tact and touch as it expands the virtual towards its potential. Layer upon layer of new information has been repeatedly revising and reformulating our sense of touch. The uncondi-tional freedom of touch needs to be rendered accountable in this rift of time and space. The act of touching entails individual acknowledging the risk of reaching towards the unknown or the known. Tracing with a tactile sense of touch is to be tactful about how, where and what can such act of touching could reach, especially in the context of communicative technology. This article focuses on the possibil-ity of virtual sensibility by challenging ways to feel touched beyond the nostal-gic narratives that attempt to indict communicative technology with the loss of touch. To replenish and reinstate touch through tele-synaesthesia performance, I ask: how to elongate our somatosensensation and echo the embodied experience of touching through virtual connectivity? Tele-synaesthesia performance joints tele-matic and synaesthetic experience together to embody the incorporeality of touch through virtual connectivity. It embodies the injunction of physical contact and challenges what can and cannot be touched by suturing one sensuous modality to another. Inspired by Paul Sermon's artistic production of Telematic Quarantine (2020) and Pandemic Encounters (2020), that tele-presents the stories of self (isolation), I have created The Best Facial (2021): a series of one-to-one participatory tele-synaesthesia performances, where I became a virtual aesthetician and performed 'virtual facial care' on Zoom amid the second wave of the pandemic in the United Kingdom. In this article, I will discuss how tele-synaesthesia performance could trigger tactile experiences in the participants in reference to Michel Foucault's concept Heterotopia (1986) that allegorically address the incompatible physical places in the society. I discuss how to elicit an affective sensory response from non-tactile senses through virtual touch, as stated by Naomi Bennett's 'Telematic connections: sensing, feeling, being in space together' (2020). I refer to Legacy Russell's discussion on glitch (2020) to analyse the possible future of tele-synaesthesia performance and its potential for expanding virtual connectivity with an ethical touch of a non-performative refusal of the present.",2021,"Hao, A.

WHO,Severe COVID-19 infection in a patient with a blastic transformation of a chronic myeloid leukemia and severe treatment-induced immunosuppression: a case report,"The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread across the globe, leading to the declaration of a pandemic. While most present mild symptoms, it appears as though nearly 20% of confirmed patients develop significant complications. At this time of uncertainty, we are struggling to provide appropriate care to hematological cancer patients.

Medline; PMC,Predictive Value of Immune Cell Subsets for Mortality Risk in Patients With Sepsis,"This study investigates the prognostic value of immune cell subsets in assessing the risk of death in patients with sepsis. This retrospective study collected 169 patients from March 2020 to February 2021 at our hospital. Baseline data were collected from patients. The absolute values (Abs) and percentages (%) of immune cell subsets for lymphocytes, T cells, CD4+ cells, CD8+, B cells, NK cells, and NKT cells were measured using flow Cytometry. Among the included patients, 43 patients were in the nonsurvivor group and 126 patients were in the survivor group. The age of patients in the nonsurvivor survivor was higher than that of survivor group patients (P = .020). SOFA, APACHE II, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin were higher in the nonsurvivor group than in the survivor group (all P values < .05). Multivariate regression analysis showed that lymphocytes (%) and SOFA were independent risk factors affecting patients’ prognosis. Lymphocytes (%) have the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (0.812). The model area under the ROC curve for immune cell subsets was 0.800, with a sensitivity of 72.09%, and specificity of 79.27% (z = 7.796, P < .001). Analysis of patient prognosis by immune cell subsets diagnostic showed statistically significant differences in the grouping of cut-off values for all 5 indicators (all P < .05).

Elsevier; Medline; PMC,Effects of foliar selenium application on growth and rhizospheric soil micro-ecological environment of Atractylodes macrocephala Koidz,"Atractylodes macrocephala (A. macrocephala), a famous medicinal herb in China, is widely cultivated and consumed in China with various beneficial effects. Numerous studies have shown that selenium (Se) plays an important role in promoting plant growth, although Se has not been considered an essential element for higher plants. The objectives of this research were to determine the effects of foliar Se application (0, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0 and 20.0 mg m(−2) Se in sodium selenite, sprayed monthly from May to August) on the growth and rhizospheric soil micro-ecological environment of A. macrocephala, and explore the possible mechanisms underlying plant response to foliar Se application through a field experiment. The results were: The foliar application of 5.0 mg m(−2) Se significantly increased the survival rate of A. macrocephala compared to the control. The yield of A. macrocephala was increased when the Se level maintained belowed 10.0 mg m(−2) but decreased when Se level reached 20.0 mg m(−2). The Se content in the rhizome of A. macrocephala showed a significant positive correlation with the Se level, while the insect attack rate was significantly negatively correlated with the Se level. However, foliar Se application hardly affected the concentration of bioactive compound atractylenolide in the rhizome of A. macrocephala. Notably, the application of foliar Se changed the content of partial soil nutrients, microbial diversity and composition in the rhizosphere soil of A. macrocephala. Bacterial diversity was positively correlated with A. macrocephala growth whereas fungal diversity was negatively correlated, suggesting that microbial diversity in the rhizosphere soils is closely related to plant growth. Moreover, correlation analysis showed that available potassium, Burkholderia and Cupriavidus in rhizospheric soil might be critical factors for promoting the growth of A. macrocephala. Overall, the foliar application of Se at moderate concentration was beneficial for the growth of A. macrocephala, and 5.0-10.0 mg m(−2) Se level was the optimum. Our findings revealed novel insights into the response of A. macrocephala to foliar Se application from plant growth, rhizospheric soil nutrient and microbial community composition .",2020-10-22,"Zhou, Wuxian; Duan, Yuanyuan; Zhang, Yajuan; Wang, Hua; Huang, Donghai; Zhang, Meide",S Afr J Bot

Medline,Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is a safe option for benign lung diseases requiring lobectomy.,"BACKGROUND Lobectomy for benign lung disease is renowned to be technically complex and to be subjected to an increased complication rate. The objective of this study was to evaluate whether the results obtained with video-assisted surgery (VATS) in benign disease are comparable to those obtained in oncologic surgery, where VATS has been validated. METHODS We have reviewed the files of 246 consecutive patients who underwent VATS lobectomy from January 2012 to August 2015. The cohort was divided into two groups according to pathology (benign or malignant). Outcome parameters on scrutiny were demographics, pathology, duration of air leak, drainage and hospital stay, conversion, and perioperative complication rate. Comparisons were made with the χ 2 test and Student's t test; any p value ≤0.05 was considered as significant. RESULTS Group 1 (36 patients) included patients who underwent lobectomy for benign disease and group 2 (210 patients) patients affected by lung cancer or pulmonary metastases. The two groups differed with reference to age (p < 0.001), history of cancer (p < 0.001), history of stroke (p = 0.05), and the presence of pleural adhesions (p = 0.03). There was no difference for duration of air leaks, chest tube drainage and hospital stay, conversion rate, and perioperative complication rate. CONCLUSIONS We conclude that pathology did not impact on outcomes after VATS lobectomy. This study suggests that VATS is as a safe option in selected patients with benign disease requiring lobectomy, despite a more complex technical context.",2017,"Mazzella, Antonio; Olland, Anne; Garelli, Elena; Renaud, Stephane; Reeb, Jeremie; Santelmo, Nicola; Falcoz, Pierre Emmanuel; Massard, Gilbert",Surgical endoscopy
WHO,Critical Care Requirements Under Uncontrolled Transmission of SARS-CoV-2,"Objectives. To estimate the critical care bed capacity that would be required to admit all critical COVID-19 cases in a setting of unchecked SARS-CoV-2 transmission, both with and without elderly-specific protection measures.Methods. Using electronic health records of all 2432 COVID-19 patients hospitalized in a large hospital in Madrid, Spain, between February 28 and April 23, 2020, we estimated the number of critical care beds needed to admit all critical care patients. To mimic a hypothetical intervention that halves SARS-CoV-2 infections among the elderly, we randomly excluded 50% of patients aged 65 years and older.Results. Critical care requirements peaked at 49 beds per 100 000 on April 1-2 weeks after the start of a national lockdown. After randomly excluding 50% of elderly patients, the estimated peak was 39 beds per 100 000.Conclusions. Under unchecked SARS-CoV-2 transmission, peak critical care requirements in Madrid were at least fivefold higher than prepandemic capacity. Under a hypothetical intervention that halves infections among the elderly, critical care peak requirements would have exceeded the prepandemic capacity of most high-income countries.Public Health Implications.

Medline; PMC,Establishment of feline intestinal epithelial cell cultures for the propagation and study of feline enteric coronaviruses,"Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is the most feared infectious cause of death in cats, induced by feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV). This coronavirus is a virulent mutant of the harmless, ubiquitous feline enteric coronavirus (FECV). To date, feline coronavirus (FCoV) research has been hampered by the lack of susceptible cell lines for the propagation of serotype I FCoVs. In this study, long-term feline intestinal epithelial cell cultures were established from primary ileocytes and colonocytes by simian virus 40 (SV40) T-antigen- and human Telomerase Reverse Transcriptase (hTERT)-induced immortalization. Subsequently, these cultures were evaluated for their usability in FCoV research. Firstly, the replication capacity of the serotype II strains WSU 79–1683 and WSU 79–1146 was studied in the continuous cultures as was done for the primary cultures. In accordance with the results obtained in primary cultures, FCoV WSU 79–1683 still replicated significantly more efficient compared to FCoV WSU 79–1146 in both continuous cultures. In addition, the cultures were inoculated with faecal suspensions from healthy cats and with faecal or tissue suspensions from FIP cats. The cultures were susceptible to infection with different serotype I enteric strains and two of these strains were further propagated. No infection was seen in cultures inoculated with FIPV tissue homogenates. In conclusion, a new reliable model for FCoV investigation and growth of enteric field strains was established. In contrast to FIPV strains, FECVs showed a clear tropism for intestinal epithelial cells, giving an explanation for the observation that FECV is the main pathotype circulating among cats.",2013-08-21,"Desmarets, Lowiese MB; Theuns, Sebastiaan; Olyslaegers, Dominique AJ; Dedeurwaerder, Annelike; Vermeulen, Ben L; Roukaerts, Inge DM; Nauwynck, Hans J",Vet Res
WHO,Emergency management of the pre-hospital phase in COVID-19 patient: Literature review,The addition of COVID-19 cases took place quite quickly and has spread between countries. The high incidence is important to improve health services especially the pre-hospital phase services. In this phase good emergency management will reduce the number of disabilities to death by up to 50% by starting from activating calls prior to the incident location health workers who understand first aid and transportation using an ambulance and being observed until they arrive at the hospital. Knowing the Pre-Hospital Phase Emergency Management in COVID-19 Patient: Literature Review. The research method used is a literature review. In this method online searches for articles journals and books are carried out using accessible databases namely Google Scholar PubMed and Biomed Central. It is known from 10 Literature Articles journals and books in the emergency management of COVID-19 in the Pre-Hospital phase must be done as much as possible to minimize the number of deaths and transmission that occurs. Handling of emergency COVID-19 in the Pre-Hospital phase includes: Basic and Advanced Life Support (BLS) Oxygen Therapy Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and Patient Transport. It is important for medical personnel to pay attention to many things in providing emergency nursing care to COVID-19 patient. Pre-Hospital emergency measures for patient with COVID-19 can be carried out in various ways to improve the patient condition while at the Pre-Hospital besides that it can also prevent transmission to medical personnel and people around COVID-19 patient.,2021,"Mohtar, M.

WHO,Comparison of optimal distribution route for personal protection equipment by saving matrix and tabu search methods using nearest neighbor approach at covid-19 referral hospitals in west java,"At the beginning of COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, the disease was spread across the universe. This virus has level of blistering transmission because it can be transmitted through the air. To contain the outbreak, the people need to be self-isolated to minimize interaction with other people. In this case, the health workers are on the front line to combat this COVID-19 pandemic. It is because they must be dealing with the affected patients directly by taking care of them during their self-isolation period. The health workers must wear personal protective equipment (PPE) to avoid the virus transmission. In this turmoil, the availability of personal protective equipment or PPE is quite worrying. Therefore, the Indonesian government and every government around the world are arm in arm organize a worldwide aid in the form of PPE distribution through referral hospitals, with the objective of making the health workers safer. This research is aimed at conducting a simulation of distribution to obtain PPE route distribution in a more effective and efficient ways to get an optimal route. In this case, this research had been conducted by comparing two methods: Saving matrix and tabu search for Hazmat suit distribution. Apart from getting an optimal route, the cost and time could be pushed more effectively to clock the fastest time in distribution with the fewest cost of distribution. The simulation of distribution point used was Distribution Center of West Java as an origin point, specifically at the COVID-19 referral hospitals in West Java, which was listed on the PIKOBAR site as the beneficiary of the PPE and the data of health workers in West Java mentioned in Central Agency on Statistics or locally known as BPS as the determinant of the requested PPE numbers. The result of this research showed that Tabu Search method was more optimal compared to Saving Matrix method based on similar approach, Nearest Neighbor, in determining the route that resulted in four distribution routes. This study showed that Saving Matrix research method concluded a mileage of 2.404 km in 80 hours at the cost of Rp. 10.505.968, while Tabu Search concluded a mileage of 2.351 km in 78 hours at the cost of Rp. 10.437.492. © 2021 Karadeniz Technical University.

Medline; PMC; WHO,Effectors of the Stenotrophomonas maltophilia Type IV Secretion System Mediate Killing of Clinical Isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa,"Previously, we documented that Stenotrophomonas maltophilia encodes a type IV secretion system (T4SS) that allows the organism to kill, in contact-dependent fashion, heterologous bacteria, including wild-type Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Bioinformatic screens based largely on the presence of both a C-terminal consensus sequence and an adjacent gene encoding a cognate immunity protein identified 13 potential antibacterial effectors, most of which were highly conserved among sequenced strains of S. maltophilia. The immunity proteins of two of these proved especially capable of protecting P. aeruginosa and Escherichia coli against attack from the Stenotrophomonas T4SS. In turn, S. maltophilia mutants lacking the putative effectors RS14245 and RS14255 were impaired for killing not only laboratory E. coli but clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa, including ones isolated from the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients. That complemented mutants behaved as wild type did confirmed that RS14245 and RS14255 are required for the bactericidal activity of the S. maltophilia T4SS. Moreover, a mutant lacking both of these proteins was as impaired as a mutant lacking the T4SS apparatus, indicating that RS14245 and RS14255 account for (nearly) all of the bactericidal effects seen. Utilizing an interbacterial protein translocation assay, we determined that RS14245 and RS14255 are bona fide substrates of the T4SS, a result confirmed by examination of mutants lacking both the T4SS and the individual effectors. Delivery of the cloned 14245 protein (alone) into the periplasm resulted in the killing of target bacteria, indicating that this effector, a putative lipase, is both necessary and sufficient for bactericidal activity.",2021-06-29,"Nas, Megan Y.; Gabell, Jeffrey; Cianciotto, Nicholas P.",mBio

An alternative algorithm adapted to the intensive care unit (ICU) population has been proposed (AspICU), but this algorithm did not include microbial biomarkers such as the galactomannan antigen and the Aspergillus quantitative PCR. The objective of the present pilot study was to evaluate a new algorithm that includes fungal biomarkers (BM-AspICU) for the diagnosis of probable IPA in an ICU population. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Data from 35 patients with pathology-proven IPA according to European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer/Mycosis Study Group (EORTC/MSGERC)-2008 criteria were extracted from the French multicenter database of the Invasive Fungal Infections Surveillance Network (RESSIF). The patients were investigated according to the AspICU algorithm, and the BM-AspICU algorithm in analyzing the clinical, imaging, and biomarker data available in the records, without taking into account the pathology findings. RESULTS: Eight patients had to be excluded because no imaging data were recorded in the database. Among the 27 proven IPAs with complete data, 16 would have been considered as putative IPA with the AspICU algorithm and 24 would have been considered as probable IPA using the new algorithm BM-AspICU. Seven out of the 8 patients with probable BM-AspICU IPA (and not classified with the AspICU algorithm) had no host factors and no Aspergillus-positive broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) culture. Three patients were non-classifiable with any of the two algorithms, because they did not have any microbial criteria during the course of the infection, and diagnosis of proven aspergillosis was done using autopsy samples. CONCLUSION: Inclusion of biomarkers could be effective to identify probable IPA in the ICU population. A prospective study is needed to validate the routine application of the BM-AspICU algorithm in the ICU population.",2021-03-08,"Hamam, Joffrey; Navellou, Jean-Christophe; Bellanger, Anne-Pauline; Bretagne, Stéphane; Winiszewski, Hadrien; Scherer, Emeline; Piton, Gael; Millon, Laurence",Ann Intensive Care
Medline,Eukaryotic life without tQCUG: the role of Elongator-dependent tRNA modifications in Dictyosteliumdiscoideum.,"In the Elongator-dependent modification pathway, chemical modifications are introduced at the wobble uridines at position 34 in transfer RNAs (tRNAs), which serve to optimize codon translation rates. Here, we show that this three-step modification pathway exists in Dictyostelium discoideum, model of the evolutionary superfamily Amoebozoa. Not only are previously established modifications observable by mass spectrometry in strains with the most conserved genes of each step deleted, but also additional modifications are detected, indicating a certain plasticity of the pathway in the amoeba. Unlike described for yeast, D. discoideum allows for an unconditional deletion of the single tQCUG gene, as long as the Elongator-dependent modification pathway is intact. In gene deletion strains of the modification pathway, protein amounts are significantly reduced as shown by flow cytometry and Western blotting, using strains expressing different glutamine leader constructs fused to GFP. Most dramatic are these effects, when the tQCUG gene is deleted, or Elp3, the catalytic component of the Elongator complex is missing. In addition, Elp3 is the most strongly conserved protein of the modification pathway, as our phylogenetic analysis reveals. The implications of this observation are discussed with respect to the evolutionary age of the components acting in the Elongator-dependent modification pathway.",2020-07-01,"Schäck, Manfred A; Jablonski, Kim Philipp; Gräf, Stefan; Klassen, Roland; Schaffrath, Raffael; Kellner, Stefanie; Hammann, Christian",Nucleic acids research

While there were mathematical models of COVID-19 transmission, there were no established or tested protocols of COVID-19 testing or mitigation for school administrators to follow. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of a multifaceted COVID-19 mitigation strategy using social, behavioral, and educational interventions and a program of frequent testing with prevalence of disease spread. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This cohort study was conducted as a retrospective review of COVID-19 positivity from August 16, 2020, to April 30, 2021, at Delaware State University, a publicly funded historically Black university. Participants included all students, faculty, and staff members with a campus presence. Positivity rates after use of mitigation strategies and testing on campus were compared with those of the surrounding community. Data were analyzed from July through September 2021. EXPOSURES: Mitigation strategies included education and outreach about social distancing, masking, and handwashing, and a COVID-19 testing plan consisted of twice-weekly polymerase chain reaction (PCR) screening using anterior nasal samples (fall and early spring semester) and then saliva-based samples (middle to late spring semester). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Cumulative tests, infections, daily quarantine, and isolation residence hall occupancy were measured, and comparisons were made with statewide COVID-19 positivity rates. RESULTS: The campus cohort included 2320 individuals (1575 resident students, 415 nonresident students, and 330 faculty or staff members). There were 1488 (64.1%) women and 832 (35.9%) men; mean (SD) age was 27.5 (12.9) years. During the fall semester, 36 500 COVID-19 PCR tests were performed. Weekly positivity rates ranged from 0 of 372 tests to 16 of 869 tests (1.8%) (mean [SD] positivity rate, 0.5% [0.5%]; 168 positive results and 36 312 negative results). During the same period, statewide positivity ranged from 589 of 25 120 tests (2.3%) to 5405 of 54 596 tests (9.9%) (mean [SD] positivity rate, 4.8% [2.6%]).

Weekly positivity rates ranged from 4 of 2028 tests (0.2%) to 36 of 900 tests (4.0%) (mean [SD] positivity rate, 0.8% [0.9%]; 267 positive results and 38 767 negative results). During the same period, statewide positivity ranged from 1336 of 37 254 tests (3.6%) to 3630 of 42 458 tests (8.5%) (mean [SD] positivity rate, 5.1% [1.3%]). Compared with statewide rates, campus positivity rates were mean (SD) 4.4 (2.6) percentage points lower during the fall semester (P < .001) and mean (SD) 5.6 (1.6) percentage points lower during the spring semester (P < .001). Total daily quarantine and isolation residence hall occupancy ranged from 0 to 43 students in the fall and 1 to 47 students during the spring. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that the combination of campuswide mitigation policies and twice-weekly COVID-19 PCR screening was associated with a significant decrease in COVID-19 positivity at a residential historically Black university campus compared with the surrounding community. Given the socioeconomic demographics of many students at historically Black colleges and universities, keeping these resident campuses open is critical not only to ensure access to educational resources, but also to provide housing and food security.",2021-12-13,"Hockstein, Neil G.; Moultrie, LaKresha; Fisher, Michelle; Mason, R.

MedRxiv; WHO,Estimating the early impact of immunization against COVID-19 on deaths among elderly people in Brazil: analyses of secondary data on vaccine coverage and mortality.,"ABSTRACT Background Immunization against COVID-19 in Brazil started in January 2021, with health workers and the elderly as the priority groups. We assessed whether there was an impact of immunizations on the mortality of individuals aged 80+ years. Methods By April 22, 2021, 147,454 COVID-19 deaths had been reported to the Brazilian Mortality Information System. Denominators for mortality rates were calculated by correcting population estimates for all-cause deaths reported in 2020. Proportionate mortality at ages 80+ and 90+ years relative to deaths at all ages were calculated, and mortality rate ratios compared these two age groups with individuals aged 0-79 years. Vaccine coverage data were obtained from the Ministry of Health vaccination monitoring website. All results were tabulated by two-week periods from epidemiological weeks 1-14, 2021. Findings As the P.1 variant spread throughout Brazil, the total number of deaths increased over time starting in epidemiological week 9 of 2021. The proportion of all deaths occurring at ages 80+ years was over 25% in weeks 1-6 and declined rapidly to 13.1% in weeks 13-14. Mortality rates were over 13 times higher in the 80+ years age group compared to that of 0-79 year olds up to week 6, and declined to 6.9 times in weeks 13-14. Coronavac accounted for 77.3% and AstraZeneca for 15.9% of all doses administered. Vaccination coverage (first dose) increased rapidly among individuals aged 80+ years, reaching 49.1% in weeks 5-6 and over 90% after week 9. Interpretation Rapid scaling up of vaccination coverage among elderly Brazilians was associated with an important decline in relative mortality compared to younger individuals, in a setting where the P.1 variant predominates. Had mortality rates among the elderly remained proportionate to what was observed up to week 6, an estimated additional 13,824 deaths would have been expected up to week 14.",2021-04-30,"Victora, C.

Medline; WHO,NK cell receptor and ligand composition influences the clearance of SARS-CoV-2,"To explore how the immune system controls clearance of SARS-CoV-2, we used a single-cell, mass cytometry-based proteomics platform to profile the immune systems of 21 patients who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection without need for admission to an intensive care unit or for mechanical ventilation. We focused on receptors involved in interactions between immune cells and virus-infected cells. We found that the diversity of receptor repertoires on natural killer (NK) cells was negatively correlated with the viral clearance rate. In addition, NK subsets expressing the receptor DNAM1 were increased in patients who more rapidly recovered from infection. Ex vivo functional studies revealed that NK subpopulations with high DNAM1 expression had cytolytic activities in response to target cell stimulation. We also found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced the expression of CD155 and nectin-4, ligands of DNAM1 and its paired coinhibitory receptor TIGIT, which counterbalanced the cytolytic activities of NK cells. Collectively, our results link the cytolytic immune responses of NK cells to the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and show that the DNAM1 pathway modulates host-pathogen interactions during SARS-CoV-2 infection.",2021,"Hsieh, Wan-Chen; Lai, En-Yu; Liu, Yu-Ting; Wang, Yi-Fu; Tzeng, Yi-Shiuan; Cui, Lu; Lai, Yun-Ju; Huang, Hsiang-Chi; Huang, Jia-Hsin; Ni, Hung-Chih; Tsai, Dong-Yan; Liang, Jian-Jong; Liao, Chun-Che; Lu, Ya-Ting; Jiang, Laurence; Liu, Ming-Tsan; Wang, Jann-Tay; Chang, Sui-Yuan; Chen, Chung-Yu; Tsai, Hsing-Chen; Chang, Yao-Ming; Wernig, Gerlinde; Li, Chia-Wei; Lin, Kuo-I; Lin, Yi-Ling; Tsai, Huai-Kuang; Huang, Yen-Tsung; Chen, Shih-Yu",J. clin. invest

WHO,A COVID-19 contextual study of customers’ mistreatment and counterproductive work behavior at coffee cafés,"PurposeThe issue of customer mistreatment in food and retail sectors has come under the spotlight during the COVID-19 crisis. The purpose of this paper is to examine the problem in the COVID-19 pandemic context and study its implications for employee counterproductive behavior in the workplace. Specifically, this study aims to investigate the relationship between customer mistreatment and employee counterproductive behavior by considering the mediating role of cognitive rumination and moderating role of servant leadership at coffee cafés that operated during the COVID-19 smart lockdown period.Design/methodology/approachStructured questionnaires were distributed to 479 frontline staff working at cafés and coffee shops located in two large cities of Pakistan. The questionnaire data were analyzed by using bootstrapped regression procedures to determine how the investigated variables influenced counterproductive work behavior during the pandemic.FindingsThe findings revealed a positive influence of customer mistreatment on counterproductive work behavior both directly as well as indirectly in the presence of employee rumination as a mediator. Furthermore, the presence of servant leadership at cafés and coffee shops was found to moderate the impact of customer mistreatment during the pandemic.Originality/valueThe study offers a novel insight into the relationships between mistreatment by customers, counterproductive work behavior, employee rumination and servant leadership in the COVID-19 pandemic context, hitherto unexplored.",2021,"Ahmed, Ishfaq Islam Talat Ahmad Saima Kaleem Ahmad",British Food Journal

There continues to be a global effort to present serological data on SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in different individuals. As such, this study aimed to characterize the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in the Cypriot population for the first time since the pandemic started. Our results show that a majority of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 developed IgG antibodies against the virus, whether anti-NP, anti-S1RBD, or both, at least 20 days after their infection. Additionally, the percentage of people with at least one antibody against SARS-CoV-2 in the group of volunteers deemed SARS-CoV-2 negative via RT-PCR or who remain untested/undetermined (14.43%) is comparable to other reported percentages worldwide, ranging anywhere from 0.2% to 24%. We postulate that these percentages reflect the underreporting of true infections in the population, and also show the steady increase of herd immunity.

Medline,Patient-Reported Questionnaires to Identify Adverse Drug Reactions: A Systematic Review.,"BACKGROUND This systematic review aims to summarise available patient-reported questionnaires to detect adverse drug reactions (ADRs) that can be utilised by healthcare professionals in clinical practice and to summarise the psychometric properties (validity, reliability, and responsiveness) of the questionnaires. METHODS A systematic literature search was conducted using Medline, Pubmed, Embase, and Emcare databases to screen for articles published between January 2000 and July 2020. Data items regarding validity, reliability, and responsiveness were extracted independently by two authors. The methodological quality was assessed using the COSMIN (Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments) checklist. RESULTS A total of 1563 unique article titles were identified after removing duplicates. Following shortlisting of relevant articles, 19 patient-reported ADR questionnaires were identified. Questionnaires most commonly focused on mental health medications (42.1%, n = 8), followed by general questionnaires applicable to any medication (21.1%, n = 4). Many questionnaires did not report assessing the validity and reliability of the measurement tool. For example, only 11 questionnaires (58%) mentioned assessing content validity, in addition to criterion or construct testing. CONCLUSION This systematic review summarised the available patient-reported questionnaires that can be used in research and clinical practice to identify ADRs. Results of this systematic review highlight the need for more robust validity and reliability testing when developing patient-reported ADR questionnaires.",2021-11-12,"Lim, Renly; Ellett, Lisa Kalisch; Roughead, Elizabeth E; Cheah, Phaik Yeong; Masnoon, Nashwa",International journal of environmental research and public health
WHO,The anti-inflammatory cytokine response characterized by elevated interleukin-10 is a stronger predictor of severe disease and poor outcomes than the pro-inflammatory cytokine response in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19),"OBJECTIVES: Severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with a dysregulated immune state. While research has focused on the hyperinflammation, little research has been performed on the compensatory anti-inflammatory response. The aim of this study was to evaluate the anti-inflammatory cytokine response to COVID-19, by assessing interleukin-10 (IL-10) and IL-10/lymphocyte count ratio and their association with outcomes. METHODS: Adult patients presenting to the emergency department (ED) with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 were recruited. The primary endpoint was maximum COVID-19 severity within 30 days of index ED visit. RESULTS: A total of 52 COVID-19 patients were enrolled. IL-10 and IL-10/lymphocyte count were significantly higher in patients with severe disease (p<0.05), as well as in those who developed severe acute kidney injury (AKI) and new positive bacterial cultures (all p&#8804;0.01). In multivariable analysis, a one-unit increase in IL-10 and IL-10/lymphocyte count were associated with 42% (p=0.031) and 32% (p=0.013) increased odds, respectively, of severe COVID-19. When standardized to a one-unit standard deviations scale, an increase in the IL-10 was a stronger predictor of maximum 30-day severity and severe AKI than increases in IL-6 or IL-8. CONCLUSIONS: The hyperinflammatory response to COVID-19 is accompanied by a simultaneous anti-inflammatory response, which is associated with poor outcomes and may increase the risk of new positive bacterial cultures. IL-10 and IL-10/lymphocyte count at ED presentation were independent predictors of COVID-19 severity. Moreover, elevated IL-10 was more strongly associated with outcomes than pro-inflammatory IL-6 or IL-8. The anti-inflammatory response in COVID-19 requires further investigation to enable more precise immunomodulatory therapy against SARS-CoV-2.",2021,"Henry, Brandon Michael; Benoit, Stefanie W; Vikse, Jens; Berger, Brandon A; Pulvino, Christina; Hoehn, Jonathan; Rose, James; Santos de Oliveira, Maria Helena; Lippi, Giuseppe; Benoit, Justin L",Clin Chem Lab Med
Medline; PMC; WHO,"Clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics of COVID-19-infected children admitted to pediatric intensive care unit: a single-center experience","BACKGROUND: During the second wave of COVID-19, there is an increasing incidence of reported cases in children compared to the early wave. Data on the clinical and laboratory characteristics of COVID-19 in children are evolving, and reports on the characteristics and outcomes of severe COVID-19 in children are still under evaluation. We aimed to describe the clinical, laboratory, and radiological characteristics and outcomes of children with COVID-19 infection admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). RESULTS: The study included 27 children with COVID-19 infection. Fever, respiratory, and gastrointestinal (GIT) symptoms were predominant presenting symptoms in our patients. The median age of our patients was 9 months (2 m–12 years). Comorbidity was reported in 59.3%. The typical laboratory findings were leukocytosis, lymphopenia, elevated C-reactive proteins levels, and elevated d-dimer levels. The most frequent radiological findings were ground-glass opacities in 100% of patients and bilateral findings in 96%, while cardiomegaly was found in 44% of patients. The multisystem inflammatory syndrome was reported in 33% of patients with GIT symptoms were the most frequent presenting symptoms. Myocarditis was reported in 22% of patients. The mortality rate in this cohort was 14.8%. On multivariate analysis, the only predictor of mortality was the development of MIS-C. CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 is more severe in children with comorbid conditions. Fever, respiratory and gastrointestinal (GIT) symptoms were predominant presenting symptoms. MIS-C is of increasing concern in children with high mortality rates.

Medline; PMC,Probiotics at War Against Viruses: What Is Missing From the Picture?,"Our world is now facing a multitude of novel infectious diseases. Bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics, albeit with increasing difficulty as many of the more common causes of infection have now developed broad spectrum antimicrobial resistance. However, there is now an even greater challenge from both old and new viruses capable of causing respiratory, enteric, and urogenital infections. Reports of viruses resistant to frontline therapeutic drugs are steadily increasing and there is an urgent need to develop novel antiviral agents. Although this all makes sense, it seems rather strange that relatively little attention has been given to the antiviral capabilities of probiotics. Over the years, beneficial strains of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) have been successfully used to treat gastrointestinal, oral, and vaginal infections, and some can also effect a reduction in serum cholesterol levels. Some probiotics prevent gastrointestinal dysbiosis and, by doing so, reduce the risk of developing secondary infections. Other probiotics exhibit anti-tumor and immunomodulating properties, and in some studies, antiviral activities have been reported for probiotic bacteria and/or their metabolites. Unfortunately, the mechanistic basis of the observed beneficial effects of probiotics in countering viral infections is sometimes unclear. Interestingly, in COVID-19 patients, a clear decrease has been observed in cell numbers of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium spp., both of which are common sources of intestinal probiotics. The present review, specifically motivated by the need to implement effective new counters to SARS-CoV-2, focusses attention on viruses capable of co-infecting humans and other animals and specifically explores the potential of probiotic bacteria and their metabolites to intervene with the process of virus infection. The goal is to help to provide a more informed background for the planning of future probiotic-based antiviral research.",2020-08-20,"Tiwari, Santosh Kumar; Dicks, Leon M.

Objective evaluation of olfactory and gustatory disturbances was elicited using the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center (CCCRC) test and gustatory function testing. Furthermore, OHRQoL was assessed using Oral Health Impact Profile (OHIP-14). Results More than half of the patients (62%) had some form of olfactory dysfunction/alteration, and 42% had poor CCCRC scores. About 14% reported ageusia, while 68% reported some form of taste alterations, and 55% reported poor OHRQoL. A statistically significant difference was reported between different ABO blood groups and subjective loss of smell (p < 0.05). The subjective loss of taste, CCCRC score, and dysgeusia were found to be independent of OHIP-14 (p > 0.05), but the taste intensity score was dependent on OHIP 14 (p < 0.05). Moreover, a majority (70.8% and 70.0%) with poor OHIP-14 scores had taste intensity scores of 3 and 4, respectively, while those with moderate (68.4% and 48.6%) OHIP-14 had scored 1 and 2, respectively. Conclusion Olfactory and gustatory disturbances were found to be a long-term feature in post-COVID-19 patients.

Elsevier; Medline; PMC; WHO,Protein provision and lower mortality in critically ill patients with COVID-19,"BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) severely impacted the management of critically ill patients, including nutritional therapy. This study aimed to verify an association between mortality and the energy and protein provided to critically ill patients affected by the SARS-CoV-2 and receiving enteral nutrition support. METHODS: Patients with confirmed COVID-19, with >7 days of stay in the ICU, on enteral nutrition were followed from the moment of hospitalization until discharge from the ICU or death. Data about age, gender, Simplified Acute Physiology Score III (SAPS3), intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, days on mechanical ventilation (MV), clinical endpoint outcome (discharge or death), and daily energy and protein provision were collected from electronic medical records. Cox regression analyses and Kaplan-Meyer curves were used in statistical analysis. RESULTS: Fifty-two patients (66.2 ± 13.1 years; 53.8% women) were enrolled in the present study. The mean length of hospitalizations and SAPS3 score were 17.8 ± 9.8 days and 78.7 ± 14.7, respectively; all patients needed mechanical ventilation (mean of days was 16.42 ± 9.1). For most patients (73.1%) the endpoint was death. Twenty-five percent of patients had protein supply >0.8 g/IBW/day. Survival during COVID-19 hospitalization at ICU was significantly different among patients according to protein supply (p = 0.005). Hazard Ratios (HR) for protein supply showed that a protein intake >0.8 g/IBW/day was associated with significantly lower mortality (HR 0.322, p = 0.049). CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that a protein supply at least > 0.8 g/IBW/day could be related to reduced mortality in ICU patients with COVID-19.",2021-07-16,"Silvah, Jose Henrique; de Lima, Cristiane Maria Martires; Nicoletti, Carolina Ferreira; Barbosa, Ana Carolina; Junqueira, Gizela Pedroso; da Cunha, Selma Freire de Carvalho; Marchini, Julio Sergio",Clin Nutr ESPEN
Medline,Preparation and Characterization of Microcapsules Containing Antioxidant Fish Protein Hydrolysates: a New Use of Bycatch in Brazil.,"In this study, we evaluated the effect of complexation and microencapsulation with pea protein on the antioxidant activity of protein hydrolysates from bycatch in Brazil. The zeta potential values of complexes changed from negative to positive with the increase of pea protein as a result of positively charged complexes formation. The increase in the ratio of pea protein/hydrolysates also resulted in increased turbidity in all samples. Particle size measurements indicated that the complexes tended to form larger aggregates (ranged from 61.5 ± 1.7 μm to 183 ± 2.8 μm). The 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity of the pea protein/fish protein hydrolysate complexes was higher than that of the protein hydrolysates alone. Moreover, increasing levels of pea protein did not affect the antioxidant activity of fish protein hydrolysates. The complexes of the Paralonchurus brasiliensis were chosen for the microencapsulation process by spray-drying. The results revealed that spray-drying did not have a significant effect (P > 0.05) on the protein hydrolysate antioxidant activity when they were complexed with pea protein. Thus, this work suggests that the complexation with pea protein and subsequent microencapsulation by spray-drying is an efficient way to protect the biological activity of protein hydrolysates obtained from bycatch. This study provides evidence for the potential use of bycatch from shrimp fisheries as functional ingredients or nutraceuticals.",2021-03-24,"Camargo, Tavani Rocha; Khelissa, Simon; Chihib, Nour Eddine; Dumas, Emilie; Wang, Jian; Valenti, Wagner C; Gharsallaoui, Adem",Marine biotechnology
Medline,Protocol for a scoping review of post-trial extensions of randomised controlled trials using individually linked administrative and registry data.,"INTRODUCTION Well-conducted randomised controlled trials (RCTs) provide the least biased estimates of intervention effects. However, RCTs are costly and time-consuming to perform and long-term follow-up of participants may be hampered by lost contacts and financial constraints. Advances in computing and population-based registries have created new possibilities for increasing the value of RCTs by post-trial extension using linkage to routinely collected administrative/registry data in order to determine long-term interventional effects. There have been recent important examples, including 20+ years follow-up studies of trials of pravastatin and mammography. Despite the potential value of post-trial extension, there has been no systematic study of this literature. This scoping review aims to characterise published post-trial extension studies, assess their value, and identify any potential challenges associated with this approach. METHODS AND ANALYSIS This review will use the recommended methods for scoping reviews. We will search MEDLINE, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. A draft search strategy is included in this protocol. Review of titles and abstracts, full texts of potentially eligible studies and data/information extraction will be conducted independently by pairs of investigators. Eligible studies will be RCTs that investigated healthcare interventions that were extended by individual linkage to administrative/registry/electronic medical records data after the completion of the planned follow-up period. Information concerning the original trial, characteristics of the extension study, any clinical, policy or ethical implications and methodological or practical challenges will be collected using standardised forms. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION As this study uses secondary data, and does not include person-level data, ethics approval is not required. We aim to disseminate these findings through journals and conferences targeting triallists and researchers involved in health data linkage. We aim to produce guidance for investigators on the conduct of post-trial extensions using routinely collected data.",2017,"Fitzpatrick, Tiffany; Perrier, Laure; Tricco, Andrea C; Straus, Sharon E; Jüni, Peter; Zwarenstein, Merrick; Lix, Lisa M; Smith, Mark; Rosella, Laura C; Henry, David A",BMJ open

The use of NIV as an alternative to invasive ventilation in severely hypoxemic patients with ARDS (ie, P(aO(2))/F(IO(2)) < 200) is not generally advisable and should be limited to hemodynamically stable patients who can be closely monitored in an intensive care unit by highly skilled staff. Early NIV application may be extremely helpful in immunocompromised patients with pulmonary infiltrates, in whom intubation dramatically increases the risk of infection, pneumonia, and death. The use of NIV in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome and other airborne diseases has generated debate, despite encouraging clinical results, mainly because of safety issues. Overall, the high rate of NIV failure suggests a cautious approach to NIV use in patients with ALI/ARDS, including early initiation, intensive monitoring, and prompt intubation if signs of NIV failure emerge.",2011,"Nava, Stefano; Schreiber, Ania; Domenighetti, Guido",Respiratory care
WHO,Browning and quality management of pear fruit by salicylic acid treatment during low temperature storage,"BACKGROUND: ""Patharnakh"" pear, a dominant cultivar in the Punjab province of India, has a shorter storage life as it matures during the hot and humid weather. Studies have reported that postharvest chemical treatments have a major role in improving the storage life of the fruit. In this study, the efficacy of different concentrations (1, 2, and 3 mM) of salicylic acid (SA), a well-known signaling molecule, was explored to overcome browning and maintain the postharvest quality of the Patharnakh pear during cold storage. RESULTS: SA treated pears were better than the untreated fruits in all of the studied parameters. SA application alleviated the rate of weight loss and respiration, and lowered the decay percentage. The efficacy of SA in the reduction of polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activity, which correlates negatively with the total phenolic content, was quite noticeable. The SA treated fruits exhibited a slower oxidation of the total phenol content by inhibiting the action of polyphenol oxidase and retaining the total phenolic content, leading to lower incidence of browning. SA effectively maintained the ascorbic acid content and superoxide dismutase activity. Total soluble solids, titratable acidity, ascorbic acid, and pH of the pears were highest with the SA treatment. CONCLUSION: The 2 mM SA treatment exhibited the best result of reducing fruit decay and tissue browning, and maintaining the postharvest quality parameters of pear up to 60 days of cold storage.

WHO,Facets of Social Innovation in Higher Education,"Emphasis on social engagement and innovation for the higher education sector is a priority, despite the various challenges that have arisen as result of Covid-19, for third level providers. It is a conversation that continues to evolve of how the higher education providers can prepare students for global citizenship and societal innovation. There are specific concerns regarding best practice and the contribution of higher education to teaching, research and ultimately public policy. Universities are embedded in teaching and research whereby the onus is to engage collaboratively with outside organisations to develop competences and create products for greater use by society. This chapter aims to explore how the higher education institutions can contribute to transforming teaching and research so that the student, and ultimately each academic community member, experiences the full value of contributing to a successful society, reflecting on sustainable partnerships, engagement, whilst reflecting the whole idea of societal innovation. Its ambition is to define spheres of influence for enhancing social innovation in higher education. © 2022, The Author(s).",2022,"McDonnell-Naughton, M.; Păunescu, C.","Innovation, Technology and Knowledge Management"

Medline; WHO,Anxiety sensitivity and intolerance of uncertainty are unique and interactive risk factors for COVID-19 safety behaviors and worries.,"Intolerance of uncertainty (IU) and anxiety sensitivity (AS) predict distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, little is known about how AS and IU jointly predict COVID-19 worries and behaviors. Structural equation modeling was used to examine the direct and interactive effects of AS and IU as related to COVID-19 worries and behaviors in two samples of community adults recruited in April 2020 (N = 642; M age = 38.50 years, SD = 10.00) and May 2020 (N = 435; M age = 34.92 years, SD = 14.98). In sample 1, there was a significant AS by IU interaction predicting COVID-19-related catastrophizing worries, stockpiling, and cleaning behaviors such that the relationship of AS to COVID-19-related behaviors was stronger at high levels of IU. However, although AS predicted some COVID-19 related worries and behaviors, AS and IU did not interact in sample 2. Across samples, AS was directly related to financial and health worries, whereas IU was not a significant predictor after controlling for AS. These findings suggest AS consistently impacts COVID-19 worries and behaviors, particularly among individuals with high IU. Brief interventions targeting AS and IU may help people cope during the COVID-19 pandemic and reintegrate following the pandemic.",2021-10-26,"Saulnier, Kevin G; Koscinski, Brandon; Volarov, Marija; Accorso, Catherine; Austin, Megan J; Suhr, Julie A; Allan, Darcey; Allan, Nicholas",Cognitive behaviour therapy

Medline; PMC; WHO,"COVID-19, Stigma, and the Ongoing Marginalization of Sex Workers and their Support Organizations","Primary or first-hand stigma, associated with sex work, sometimes disparagingly referred to as ""prostitution"" or ""whore"" stigma, was a fundamental cause of social inequities for sex workers before the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, courtesy stigma, or stigma by association linked with involvement with a stigmatized group, has long limited the ability of sex worker organizations to secure adequate funds to meet the needs of sex workers in their communities. In reaction to the pandemic, sex worker organizations quickly responded and in a variety of ways have been helping to ease the impact of the pandemic on sex workers in their communities. In November 2020, we interviewed 10 members of sex worker organizations from seven different communities across Canada about how they have been dealing with the immediate and longer-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in their communities. Three strategic actions stood out in the interviews: (1) challenging stigma to help sex workers access government emergency funding; (2) reorganizing and adapting services to provide outreach to sex workers in their communities; and (3) advocating for continuous organizational funding. The findings show that primary stigma and courtesy stigma have further marginalized sex worker organizations and their clients during the pandemic.

Medline; PMC; WHO,Assessment of thyroid function of newly diagnosed SARS-CoV-2 infected patients in Nigeria,"INTRODUCTION: the outbreak and rapid spread of the novel SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has evolved into an unprecedented global pandemic. The infection impairs several human organs and systems, however, it is not clear how it affects thyroid function. The study therefore aimed at measuring plasma levels of thyroid hormones and Hs-CRP in COVID-19 patients and apparently healthy uninfected controls to assess the possible effect of SAR-CoV-2 infection on thyroid function. METHODS: in this cross-sectional study carried out between May-August 2020, 90 consenting participants comprising 45 COVID-19 patients and 45 apparently healthy uninfected controls were recruited. Plasma FT3, FT4, TSH and Hs-CRP were measured using Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) method. Data was analysed using SPSS version 20 and statistical significance set at p < 0.05. RESULTS: the mean plasma FT3 and TSH concentrations were significantly higher in COVID-19 patients compared to controls (p < 0.001, p < 0.001 respectively). Euthyroidism was observed in all uninfected controls, whereas 35 (77.8%) COVID-19 patients were euthyroid. Sick euthyroid and subclinical hypothyroidism was observed in 7 (15.6%) and 3 (6.7%) COVID-19 patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: though there was a preponderance of euthyroidism among COVID-19 patients, significantly higher mean plasma levels of TSH and FT3, sick euthyroid syndrome and subclinical hypothyroidism observed among some COVID-19 patients may be indicative of disease-related thyroid function changes. Hence, there is need to pay attention to thyroid function during and after treatment of COVID-19.",2021-09-02,"Okwor, Chika Juliet; Meka, Ijeoma Angela; Akinwande, Kazeem Sanjo; Edem, Victory Fabian; Okwor, Vitalis Chukwuemeka",Pan Afr Med J
WHO,Recent progress and challenges in drug development against COVID-19 coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) - an update on the status,"Coronaviruses are a large group of viruses known to cause illnesses that vary between the common cold and more severe diseases to include severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). A novel coronavirus was identified in December 2019 in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. This virus represents a new strain that has not been previously identified in humans. The virus is now known as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the resulting disease is called coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a global pandemic in March 2020. Despite rigorous global containment and quarantine efforts, the incidence of COVID-19 continues to rise, with more than 1,948,617 laboratory-confirmed cases and over 121,846 deaths worldwide. Currently, no specific medication is recommended to treat COVID-19 patients. However, governments and pharmaceutical companies are struggling to quickly find an effective drug to defeat the coronavirus. In the current review, we summarize the existing state of knowledge about COVID-19, available medications, and treatment options. Favilavir is an antiviral drug that is approved in Japan for common influenza treatment and is now approved to treat symptoms of COVID-19 in China. Moreover, Chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, drugs used to treat malaria and arthritis, respectively, were recommended by the National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China for treatment of COVID-19. Presently, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are under investigation by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for COVID-19.

WHO,"Attitudes and Psychological Factors Associated With News Monitoring, Social Distancing, Disinfecting, and Hoarding Behaviors Among US Adolescents During the Coronavirus Disease 2019 Pandemic","Importance: As coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) spreads across the world, it is critical to understand the psychological factors associated with pandemic-related behaviors. This perspecitve may be especially important to study among adolescents, who are less likely to experience severe symptoms but contribute to the spread of the virus. Objective: To examine psychological factors associated with adolescents' behaviors during the COVID-19 pandemic. Design, Setting, and Participants: This self-reported survey conducted from March 20 to 22, 2020, recruited a population-based sample of adolescents via social media to complete an anonymous survey. Participants were eligible if they had internet access, lived in the United States, and were aged 13 to 18 years. Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes included COVID-19 news monitoring, social distancing, disinfecting, and hoarding behaviors during the 7 days after the United States declared a national emergency. The psychological factors were attitudes about COVID-19 severity, social responsibility values, social trust, and self-interest. The a priori hypotheses were that greater attitudes about the severity of COVID-19, greater social responsibility, and greater social trust would be associated with greater news monitoring, social distancing, and disinfecting, whereas greater self-interest would be associated with more hoarding. Results: The sample included 770 adolescents collected via convenience sampling (mean [SD] age, 16.3 [1.1] years; 575 girls [74.7%]). Many teens reported not engaging in pure social distancing (528 [68.6%]), but they were monitoring the news (688 [89.4%]) and disinfecting daily (676 [87.8%]). Some teens reported hoarding (152 [19.7%]). Attitudes about the greater severity of COVID-19 were associated with more social distancing (ß = 0.18; 95% CI = 0.10 to 0.25), disinfecting (ß = 0.16; 95% CI = 0.08 to 0.23), and news monitoring (ß = 0.26; 95% CI = 0.18 to 0.33) but also more hoarding (ß = 0.08; 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.16). Greater social responsibility was associated with more disinfecting (ß = 0.24; 95% CI = 0.17 to 0.32) and news monitoring (ß = 0.14; 95% CI = 0.07 to 0.22) and less hoarding (ß = -0.07; 95% CI = -0.14 to -0.01). Greater self-interest values were associated with less social distancing (ß = -0.08; 95% CI = -0.15 to -0.01) and more hoarding (ß = 0.08; 95% CI = 0.01 to 0.15). Greater social trust was associated with less hoarding (ß = -0.09; 95% CI, -0.16 to -0.02). Conclusions and Relevance: The results of this survey study suggest that emphasizing the severity of COVID-19 and the social implications of pandemic-related behaviors may be important for teens, particularly for those who are not following preventive health behaviors or who are engaging in hoarding.",2020,"Oosterhoff, Benjamin; Palmer, Cara A",JAMA pediatr.

Materiales y métodos: Este estudio se realizó de forma retrospectiva en 68 pacientes COVID-19 con enfermedad crónica que fueron tratados por diferentes protocolos terapéuticos. Los pacientes se clasificaron en cuatro grupos: el grupo de control representaba los resultados de laboratorio de los pacientes en el momento de la admisión antes de que se aplicaran los protocolos de tratamiento; el grupo 1 incluyó a pacientes tratados con anticoagulantes, Hidroxicloroquina y antibióticos; el grupo 2 estaba compuesto por pacientes tratados con Dexametasona; y el grupo 3 incluyó a pacientes tratados con Dexametasona y Tocilizumab. Resultados: Los recuentos de glóbulos blancos y neutrófilos aumentaron significativamente en el grupo 3 tras el tratamiento cuando se compararon con los pacientes del grupo 1 (p= 0,004 y p= 0,001, respectivamente). La comparación del nivel de proteína C reactiva (CRP) al ingreso fue mayor en el grupo 3 que en el grupo 1 con p= 0.030.

Medline; PMC,Estimating Clinically Relevant Cut-Off Values for a High-Throughput Quantitative Real-Time PCR Detecting Bacterial Respiratory Pathogens in Cattle,"Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) results from interactions between pathogens, environmental stressors, and host factors. Obtaining a diagnosis of the causal pathogens is challenging but the use of high-throughput real-time PCR (rtPCR) may help target preventive and therapeutic interventions. The aim of this study was to improve the interpretation of rtPCR results by analysing their associations with clinical observations. The objective was to develop and illustrate a field-data driven statistical method to guide the selection of relevant quantification cycle cut-off values for pathogens associated with BRD for the high-throughput rtPCR system “Fluidigm BioMark HD” based on nasal swabs from calves. We used data from 36 herds enrolled in a Danish field study where 340 calves within pre-determined age-groups were subject to clinical examination and nasal swabs up to four times. The samples were analysed with the rtPCR system. Each of the 1,025 observation units were classified as sick with BRD or healthy, based on clinical scores. The optimal rtPCR results to predict BRD were investigated for Pasteurella multocida, Mycoplasma bovis, Histophilus somni, Mannheimia haemolytica, and Trueperella pyogenes by interpreting scatterplots and results of mixed effects logistic regression models. The clinically relevant rtPCR cut-off suggested for P. multocida and M. bovis was ≤ 21.3. For H. somni it was ≤ 17.4, while no cut-off could be determined for M. haemolytica and T. pyogenes. The demonstrated approach can provide objective support in the choice of clinically relevant cut-offs.

The aim of this research is to set up a system to monitor the flow of people inside public places and facilities of interest (museums, theatres, cinemas, etc.) without collecting personal or sensitive data. Weak monitoring of people flows (i.e. monitoring without personal identification of the monitored subjects) through Internet of Things tools might be a viable solution to minimize lineups and overcrowding. Our study, which began as an experiment in the Umbria region of Italy, aims to be one of several answers to automated planning of people's flows in order to make our land more liveable.

WHO,In silico prediction of new mutations that can improve the binding abilities between 2019-nCoV coronavirus and human ACE2,"The 2019-nCoV coronavirus protein was confirmed to be highly susceptible to various mutations, which can trigger apparent changes of virus' transmission capacity and even the pathogenic mechanism. In this article, the binding interface was obtained by analyzing the interaction modes between 2019-nCoV coronavirus and the human specific target protein ACE2. Based on the ""SIFT server"" and the ""bubble"" identification mechanism, 9 amino acid sites were selected as potential mutation-sites from the 2019-nCoV-S1-ACE2 binding interface. Subsequently, one total number of 171 mutant systems for 9 mutation-sites were optimized for binding-pattern comparsion analysis, and 14 mutations that may improve the binding capacity of 2019-nCoV-S1 to ACE2 were selected. The Molecular Dynamic Simulations were conducted to calculate the binding free energies of all 14 mutant systems. Finally, we found that most of the 14 mutations on the 2019-nCoV-S1 protein could enhance the binding ability between the 2019-nCoV coronavirus and the human protein ACE2. Among which, the binding capacities for G446R, Y449R and F486Y mutations could be increased by 20%, and that for S494R mutant increased even by 38.98%.

ArXiv; Medline; PMC,Stance detection with BERT embeddings for credibility analysis of information on social media,"The evolution of electronic media is a mixed blessing. Due to the easy access, low cost, and faster reach of the information, people search out and devour news from online social networks. In contrast, the increasing acceptance of social media reporting leads to the spread of fake news. This is a minacious problem that causes disputes and endangers the societal stability and harmony. Fake news spread has gained attention from researchers due to its vicious nature. proliferation of misinformation in all media, from the internet to cable news, paid advertising and local news outlets, has made it essential for people to identify the misinformation and sort through the facts. Researchers are trying to analyze the credibility of information and curtail false information on such platforms. Credibility is the believability of the piece of information at hand. Analyzing the credibility of fake news is challenging due to the intent of its creation and the polychromatic nature of the news. In this work, we propose a model for detecting fake news. Our method investigates the content of the news at the early stage i.e., when the news is published but is yet to be disseminated through social media. Our work interprets the content with automatic feature extraction and the relevance of the text pieces. In summary, we introduce stance as one of the features along with the content of the article and employ the pre-trained contextualized word embeddings BERT to obtain the state-of-art results for fake news detection.

WHO,Lessons from the pandemic on the value of research infrastructure,"The COVID-19 pandemic has shed a spotlight on the resilience of healthcare systems, and their ability to cope efficiently and effectively with unexpected crises. If we are to learn one economic lesson from the pandemic, arguably it is the perils of an overfocus on short-term allocative efficiency at the price of lack of capacity to deal with uncertain future challenges. In normal times, building spare capacity with 'option value' into health systems may seem inefficient, the costs potentially exceeding the benefits. Yet the fatal weakness of not doing so is that this can leave health systems highly constrained when dealing with unexpected, but ultimately inevitable, shocks-such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In this article, we argue that the pandemic has highlighted the potentially enormous option value of biomedical research infrastructure. We illustrate this with reference to COVID-19 response work supported by the United Kingdom National Institute for Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre. As the world deals with the fallout from the most serious economic crisis since the Great Depression, pressure will soon come to review government expenditure, including research funding. Developing a framework to fully account for option value, and understanding the public appetite to pay for it, should allow us to be better prepared for the next emerging problem.",2021,"Roope, Laurence S J; Candio, Paolo; Kiparoglou, Vasiliki; McShane, Helen; Duch, Raymond; Clarke, Philip M",Health Res Policy Syst
Medline,Long-term prognosis of preserved useful hearing after surgery in patients with vestibular schwannoma: a study of 91 cases.,"BACKGROUND In patients with a vestibular schwannoma, some studies have reported that useful hearing preserved initially after surgery deteriorates gradually in the long term. Studies with more patients are needed to clarify the maintenance rate of postoperative hearing function and to identify prognostic of hearing function. METHOD Ninety-one patients (mean age, 39.5 years; mean tumor size, 18.9 mm) with preserved useful hearing immediately after surgery were retrospectively analyzed. The useful hearing was defined as the American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery (AAO-HNS) classes A and B. Hearing tests, including auditory brainstem responses (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAE), were evaluated preoperatively, immediately after surgery, and at outpatient follow-up. RESULTS At the final follow-up (mean, 63.0 months), the useful hearing was maintained in 79 patients (87%), and the hearing class remained unchanged during the follow-up period in 40 patients (44%). Significant predictors of useful hearing maintenance were AAO-HNS class A immediately after surgery, improvement of ABR, and the absence of postoperative DPOAE deterioration. Postoperative DPOAE deterioration correlated with hearing class deterioration. CONCLUSIONS Despite hearing being preserved in vestibular schwannoma patients immediately after surgery, Thirteen percent lost their useful hearing during the long follow-up period, and hearing class worsened in 55% of the patients. This study, which analyzed one of the largest series of vestibular schwannoma patients, demonstrated that retrocochlear condition is a key factor for useful hearing maintenance.

We investigated COVID-19 anxiety, general anxiety and depression symptoms, and their impact on problematic smartphone use (PSU) severity METHODS: Participants were 908 residents of a large Eastern Chinese city, surveyed from late-February to mid-March, 2020. We administered online measures including the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21, Smartphone Addiction Scale-Short Version, and items querying COVID-19-related news exposure and threat of death. Additionally, participants rated anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale-7 with reference to COVID-19. RESULTS: COVID-19 anxiety correlated with severity of PSU, depression and anxiety. Using established cut-off scores, 12% of participants were identified with at least moderate depression, and 24% with moderate anxiety. Using structural equation modeling, COVID-19 anxiety related to PSU severity, mediating relations between general anxiety and PSU severity. However, controlling PSU for general anxiety and depression severity, COVID-19 anxiety no longer predicted PSU severity. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include the cross-sectional research design and reliance on data from only one country. CONCLUSIONS: Results are discussed in context of the I-PACE model of excessive internet use. While COVID-19 anxiety is likely a global anxiety-provoking event, other everyday worries and anxiety are additionally clinically important in driving excessive internet use.",2020,"Elhai, Jon D; Yang, Haibo; McKay, Dean; Asmundson, Gordon J G",J Affect Disord
Medline; PMC,Out Of Reach: Inequities In The Use Of High-Quality Home Health Agencies,"Patients receiving home health services from high-quality home health agencies often experience fewer adverse outcomes (for example, hospitalizations) than patients receiving services from low-quality agencies. Using administrative data from 2016 and regression analysis, we examined individual- and neighborhood-level racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic factors associated with the use of high-quality home health agencies. We found that Black and Hispanic home health patients had a 2.2-percentage-point and a 2.5-percentage-point lower adjusted probability of high-quality agency use, respectively, compared with their White counterparts within the same neighborhoods. Low-income patients had a 1.2-percentage-point lower adjusted probability of high-quality agency use compared with their higher-income counterparts, whereas home health patients residing in neighborhoods with higher proportions of marginalized residents had a lower adjusted probability of high-quality agency use. Some 40–77 percent of the disparities in high-quality agency use were attributable to neighborhood-level factors.

Medline; PMC; WHO,"Impacts of COVID-19 on sexual behaviour in Britain: findings from a large, quasi-representative survey (Natsal-COVID)","OBJECTIVES: Physical restrictions imposed to combat COVID-19 dramatically altered sexual lifestyles but the specific impacts on sexual behaviour are still emerging. We investigated physical and virtual sexual activities, sexual frequency and satisfaction in the 4 months following lockdown in Britain in March 2020 and compared with pre-lockdown. METHODS: Weighted analyses of web panel survey data collected July/August 2020 from a quota-based sample of 6654 people aged 18–59 years in Britain. Multivariable regression took account of participants’ opportunity for partnered sex, gender and age, to examine their independent associations with perceived changes in sexual frequency and satisfaction. RESULTS: Most participants (86.7%) reported some form of sex following lockdown with physical activities more commonly reported than virtual activities (83.7% vs 52.6%). Altogether, 63.2% reported sex with someone (‘partnered sex’) since lockdown, three-quarters of whom were in steady cohabiting relationships. With decreasing relationship formality, partnered sex was less frequently reported, while masturbation, sex toy use and virtual activities were more frequently reported. Around half of all participants perceived no change in partnered sex frequency compared with the 3 months pre-lockdown, but this was only one-third among those not cohabiting, who were more likely to report increases in non-partnered activities than those cohabiting. Two-thirds of participants perceived no change in sexual satisfaction; declines were more common among those not cohabiting. Relationship informality and younger age were independently associated with perceiving change, often declines, in sexual frequency and satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: Our quasi-representative study of the British population found a substantial minority reported significant shifts in sexual repertoires, frequency and satisfaction following the introduction of COVID-19 restrictions. However, these negative changes were perceived by some more than others; predominantly those not cohabiting and the young. As these groups are most likely to experience adverse sexual health, it is important to monitor behaviour as restrictions ease to understand the longer term consequences, including for health services.",2021-12-14,"Mercer, Catherine H; Clifton, Soazig; Riddell, Julie; Tanton, Clare; Freeman, Lily; Copas, Andrew J; Dema, Emily; Bosó Pérez, Raquel; Gibbs, Jo; Macdowall, Wendy; Menezes, Dee; Ridge, Mary-Clare; Bonell, Chris; Sonnenberg, Pam; Field, Nigel; Mitchell, Kirstin R",Sex Transm Infect

WHO,An identity conflict perspective on female expatriate work adjustment,"PurposeThis study aims to develop a model for female expatriate work adjustment from the identity conflict perspective.Design/methodology/approachThis is a theoretical paper that focuses on integrating the existing literature and proposing new constructive relationships.FindingsWe study female expatriates' adjustment processes in the work domain from the identity conflict perspective. Specifically, we categorize female expatriates' identities in the work domain into their gender identity and a work-related role identity cluster and propose that when gender identity is salient, unsupportive national and organizational cultures will lead to gender–work role identity conflicts and eventually result in maladjustment in the work domain.Originality/valueFirst, we suggest that female expatriates' work role identities can form a cluster that includes expatriate role, managerial role and occupational role identity. We further theorize how the gender role identity and the work-related role identity cluster of female expatriates interact to influence how they adjust to their work. Second, we explore two contingency factors – host organizational culture and host national culture–and explain how they influence the interaction between female expatriates' gender identity and work-related role identities. Finally, we introduce the concept of gender–work role identity conflict and theorize how it serves as the underlying mechanism linking female expatriate identity patterns and work adjustment.",2021,"Lu, Yu Ren Hong",Journal of Global Mobility

WHO,GeoGebra Integration in Elementary Initial Teacher Training: The Case of 3-D Shapes,"The integration of technology in learning is increasingly popular and inevitable, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. In mathematics education, Geogebra has been used as a pedagogical tool in learning mathematics from elementary to university. The present study aims to explore first-year prospective elementary teachers' experience constructing 3-D shapes using GeoGebra. This study uses a case study method with 40 first-year prospective elementary teachers from an elementary initial teacher training from a public university in Riau, Indonesia. The participants worked in small groups and discussed some 3-D shapes through an online platform, and in the end, each participant reflected their attitudes towards the integration of GeoGebra in learning 3-D shapes. The findings show that prospective elementary teachers discussed six types of 3-D shapes;cube, rectangular prism, rectangular pyramid, cylinder, cone, and spheres. They prefer to discuss curved surfaces rather than flat surfaces of 3-D shapes. In addition, prospective elementary teachers have positive attitudes towards integrating GeoGebra in elementary initial teacher training. They believe that GeoGebra supports them to understand better the concepts of volume and surface area of 3-D shapes, facilitate students to understand the properties of a geometry object, and compare the object one made using hand drawing to using GeoGebra. Meanwhile, difficulty in using the tools to construct 3-D shapes in GeoGebra becomes a hinder to understand mathematics concepts and properties. The implication of this study is that there is a potential to integrate GeoGebra in mathematics learning in elementary teacher training. © 2021. All Rights Reserved.",2021,"Putra, Z.

BioRxiv; WHO,Understanding the phase separation characteristics of nucleocapsid protein provides a new therapeutic opportunity against SARS-CoV-2,"The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has raised an urgent need to develop effective therapeutics against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As a potential antiviral drug target, the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV-2 functions as a viral RNA chaperone and plays vital and multifunctional roles during the life cycle of coronavirus1-3. In this study, we discovered that the N protein of SARS-CoV-2 undergoes liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) both in vitro and in vivo, which is further modulated by viral RNA. In addition, we found that, the core component of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of SARS-CoV-2, nsp12, preferentially partitions into the N protein condensates. Moreover, we revealed that, two small molecules, i.e., CVL218 and PJ34, can be used to intervene the N protein driven phase separation and loosen the compact structures of the condensates of the N-RNA-nsp12 complex of SARS-CoV-2. The discovery of the LLPS-mediated interplay between N protein and nsp12 and the corresponding modulating compounds illuminates a feasible way to improve the accessibility of antiviral drugs (e.g., remdesivir) to their targets (e.g., nsp12/RdRp), and thus may provide useful hints for further development of effective therapeutic strategies against SARS-CoV-2.",2020-10-09,"Zhao, Dan; Xu, Weifan; Zhang, Xiaofan; Wang, Xiaoting; Yuan, Enming; Xiong, Yuanpeng; Wu, Shenyang; Li, Shuya; Wu, Nian; Tian, Tingzhong; Feng, Xiaolong; Shu, Hantao; Lang, Peng; Shen, Xiaokun; Li, Haitao; Li, Pilong; Zeng, Jianyang",bioRxiv
WHO,Association of SARS-CoV-2 viral load at admission with in-hospital acute kidney injury: A retrospective cohort study,"BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the associated Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a public health emergency. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 although mechanisms underlying AKI are yet unclear. There may be a direct effect of SARS-CoV-2 virus on the kidney; however, there is currently no data linking SARS-CoV-2 viral load (VL) to AKI. We explored the association of SARS-CoV-2 VL at admission to AKI in a large diverse cohort of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. METHODS AND FINDINGS: We included patients hospitalized between March 13th and May 19th, 2020 with SARS-CoV-2 in a large academic healthcare system in New York City (N = 1,049) with available VL at admission quantified by real-time RT-PCR. We extracted clinical and outcome data from our institutional electronic health records (EHRs). AKI was defined by KDIGO guidelines. We fit a Fine-Gray competing risks model (with death as a competing risk) using demographics, comorbidities, admission severity scores, and log10 transformed VL as covariates and generated adjusted hazard ratios (aHR) and 95% Confidence Intervals (CIs). VL was associated with an increased risk of AKI (aHR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.01-1.08, p = 0.02) with a 4% increased hazard for each log10 VL change. Patients with a viral load in the top 50th percentile had an increased adjusted hazard of 1.27 (95% CI: 1.02-1.58, p = 0.03) for AKI as compared to those in the bottom 50th percentile. CONCLUSIONS: VL is weakly but significantly associated with in-hospital AKI after adjusting for confounders. This may indicate the role of VL in COVID-19 associated AKI.

WHO,Salt-dependent hypertension and inflammation: targeting the gut-brain axis and the immune system with Brazilian green propolis,"Systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) is a major health problem around the world and its development has been associated with exceeding salt consumption by the modern society. The mechanisms by which salt consumption increase blood pressure (BP) involve several homeostatic systems but many details have not yet been fully elucidated. Evidences accumulated over the last 60 decades raised the involvement of the immune system in the hypertension development and opened a range of possibilities for new therapeutic targets. Green propolis is a promising natural product with potent anti-inflammatory properties acting on specific targets, most of them participating in the gut-brain axis of the sodium-dependent hypertension. New anti-hypertensive products reinforce the therapeutic arsenal improving the corollary of choices, especially in those cases where patients are resistant or refractory to conventional therapy. This review sought to bring the newest advances in the field articulating evidences that show a cross-talking between inflammation and the central mechanisms involved with the sodium-dependent hypertension as well as the stablished actions of green propolis and some of its biologically active compounds on the immune cells and cytokines that would be involved with its anti-hypertensive properties.",2020,"Batista, Marcos Adriano Carlos; Braga, Daiane Cristina de Assis; de Moura, Sandra Aparecida Lima; de Souza, Gustavo Henrique Bianco; Dos Santos, Orlando David Henrique; Cardoso, Leonardo Máximo",Inflammopharmacology
Medline; WHO,AP-MALDI mass spectrometry of engine oil additive components,"RATIONALE The efficiency of lubricants strongly depends on the content of functional additives. In order to assess the chemical and structural changes taking place in the lubricating oil and its additives during operation it is essential to develop a method for simple and prompt analysis, which is described in this study. METHODS: Two single additives as well as a fully formulated engine oil were analysed using an atmospheric pressure matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (AP-MALDI) ion source coupled to a Linear Trap Quadrupole Orbitrap XL hybrid tandem mass spectrometer and compared with results obtained by means of electrospray ionization including additional low energy collision induced dissociation (LE-CID). The identification of additives directly from technical surfaces were simulated by using steel substrates as AP-MALDI target with varying roughness. RESULTS: After assessment and selection of the most suited AP-MALDI matrix it has been found that pure additives such as calcium sulfonate and zinc dialkyldithiophosphates (ZDDP) could well be identified with abundant signal intensity based on their elemental composition. Molecule identification was corroborated by LE-CID in electrospray ionization mode. Additionally, additives present in the fully formulated commercial oil such as ZDDP and salicylates could be reliably identified based on the elemental composition of the deprotonated molecules by means of the Orbitrap unit on different substrates including steel surfaces with high roughness. CONCLUSIONS: Atmospheric pressure matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization is an efficient technique for determination of lubricant additives directly from commercial oil blends. Identification of additive components was also achieved on steel surfaces with high roughness as applied in tribological systems and thus, it is expected that additive degradation will be possible to be assessed in real applications, enabling more effective and timely maintenance measures.",2022,"Ramopoulou, Lamprini; Widder, Lukas; Brenner, Josef; Ristic, Andjelka; Allmaier, Günter",Rapid Commun Mass Spectrom

WHO,Treatment for breast cancer patients during the special period of novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak,"Abstract Purpose: The outbreak of novel coronavirus pneumonia occurred worldwide. 2019 novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) can be transmitted from human to human, cause hospital infection, and seriously threatens surgical staffs and inpatients. The treatment of patients with breast cancer may be affected in this special period. Methods: From 24th January to 8th March 2020, patients diagnosed with breast cancer were enrolled from 16 hospitals in Jiangsu Province, and patients, who were candidates for surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, were also enrolled. Patients from 24th January to 8th March 2019 were included as control with the same criteria. Results: In 2019, 520 patients were diagnosed with breast cancer in these 16 hospital;however, only 229 patients (decreased by 56%) were diagnosed with breast cancer in the same period of 2020. The clinical characteristics were similar between the two groups, and core biopsy was performed to more patients in 2020 than that in 2019 (4.1 days ±3.2 vs 3.2 days ±2.6, P < 0.001), and more patients underwent mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection in 2020. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the mean interval between last time of neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgery in 2020 was significantly longer than that in 2019 (29.2 days ±11.1 vs 17.7 days ±8.2, P < 0.001). After examinations to rule out COVID-19, no COVID-19 was found in any patient. Conclusions: In the special period of novel coronavirus pneumonia outbreak, the treatment of patients with breast cancer was delayed, but the treatment was safe after strict exclusions of COVID-19.",2020,"Zhou, Wenbin Wang Shui Pan Hong Xie Hui Zhang Jiaxin Zhen Linlin Zhang Chunhui Fang Qi Cao Susheng Liu Xiao Fu Deyuan Guan Xiaoqing Jiang Guoqin Xu Lingyun Shen Enchao Geng Qiang Xiao Xiudi Gu Jun Yi Tongbo Liu Xiaoan",
Medline; PMC,Financial Toxicity in Head and Neck Cancer Patients Treated With Proton Therapy,"Cancer-related financial toxicity impacts head and neck cancer patients and survivors. With increasing use of proton therapy as a curative treatment for head and neck cancer, the multifaceted financial and economic implications of proton therapy—dimensions of “financial toxicity”—need to be addressed. Herein, we identify knowledge gaps and potential solutions related to the problem of financial toxicity. To date, while cost-effectiveness analysis has been used to assess the value of proton therapy for head and neck cancer, it may not fully incorporate empiric comparisons of patients' and survivors' lost productivity and disability after treatment. A cost-of-illness framework for evaluation could address this gap, thereby more comprehensively identifying the value of proton therapy and distinctly incorporating a measurable aspect of financial toxicity in evaluation. Overall, financial toxicity burdens remain understudied in head and neck cancer patients from a patient-centered perspective. Systematic, validated, and accurate measurement of financial toxicity in patients receiving proton therapy is needed, especially relative to conventional photon-based strategies. This will enrich the evidence base for optimal selection and rationale for payer coverage of available treatment options for head and neck cancer patients. In the setting of cancer care delivery, a combination of conducting proactive screening for financial toxicity in patients selected for proton therapy, initiating early financial navigation in vulnerable patients, engaging stakeholders, improving oncology provider team cost communication, expanding policies to promote price transparency, and expanding insurance coverage for proton therapy are critical practices to mitigate financial toxicity in head and neck cancer patients.",2021-06-25,"Smith, Grace L.; Shih, Ya-Chen Tina; Frank, Steven J.",Int J Part Ther
WHO,COVID-19 information-Tracking solutions: A qualitative investigation of the factors influencing people's adoption intention,"Numerous information-Tracking solutions have been implemented worldwide to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. While prior work has heavily explored the factors affecting people's willingness to adopt contact-Tracing solutions, which inform people when they have been exposed to someone positive for COVID-19, numerous countries have implemented other information-Tracking solutions that use more data and more sensitive data than these commonly studied contact-Tracing apps. In this work, we build on existing work focused on contact-Tracing apps to explore adoption and design considerations for six representative information-Tracking solutions for COVID-19, which differ in their goals and in the types of information they collect. To do so, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 44 participants to investigate the factors that influence their willingness to adopt these solutions. We find four main categories of influences on participants' willingness to adopt such solutions: individual benefits of the solution, societal benefits of the solution, functionality concern, and digital safety (e.g., security and privacy) concerns. Further, we enumerate the factors that inform participants' evaluations of these categories. Based on our findings, we make recommendations for the future design of information-Tracking solutions and discuss how different factors may balance against benefits in future crisis situations. © 2022 ACM.",2022,"Huang, Y.; Obada-Obieh, B.; Redmiles, E.

WHO,Adversarial Mask: Real-World Adversarial Attack Against Face Recognition Models,"Deep learning-based facial recognition (FR) models have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in the past few years, even when wearing protective medical face masks became commonplace during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the outstanding performance of these models, the machine learning research community has shown increasing interest in challenging their robustness. Initially, researchers presented adversarial attacks in the digital domain, and later the attacks were transferred to the physical domain. However, in many cases, attacks in the physical domain are conspicuous, requiring, for example, the placement of a sticker on the face, and thus may raise suspicion in real-world environments (e.g., airports). In this paper, we propose Adversarial Mask, a physical adversarial universal perturbation (UAP) against state-of-the-art FR models that is applied on face masks in the form of a carefully crafted pattern. In our experiments, we examined the transferability of our adversarial mask to a wide range of FR model architectures and datasets. In addition, we validated our adversarial mask effectiveness in real-world experiments by printing the adversarial pattern on a fabric medical face mask, causing the FR system to identify only 3.34% of the participants wearing the mask (compared to a minimum of 83.34% with other evaluated masks).",2021,"Zolfi, Alon Avidan Shai Elovici Yuval Shabtai Asaf",
WHO,Incineration of sewage sludge and recovery of residue ash as building material: A valuable option as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic,"Circular economy principles were adopted by European Commission, to support a sustainable growth. They contain general rules that should be considered in all situations. At present, during pandemic, some waste disposal practices are under evaluation to guarantee safety conditions. For example, in view of the recent results reporting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 virus in sewage sludge, the possibility that it diffuses in the environment is alarming. The situation may result critical in densely populated cities, which are the largest sources of sewage sludge. In this frame the diffused practice of reuse of this waste in agriculture is under revision. In this context, incineration may represent a valuable alternative strategy to manage sewage sludge during pandemic. Indeed, due to thermal treatment, the destruction of organic micropollutants and pathogens, eventually present in the waste, is guarantee. Moreover, it is fundamental to highlight that also if the management of sewage sludge changes, the ash resulting from its combustion may have suitable reuse opportunities, and their landfilling should be avoided. This work presents the available possibilities of sewage sludge ash recovery in building applications and shows the results obtained by the analysis of their sustainability. The approach is based on the use of embodied energy and carbon footprint values, to make a simple and fast new method able to be a suitable tool to support and promote sustainability also in critical situations (such as pandemic) and when all the information about a technology are not available, making not possible to perform a full-LCA approach. This work aims to be not only a reference paper for promotion of strategies able to increase waste management safety, but also an example showing that circular economy principles should be pursued also if boundary conditions can change.",2021,"Ducoli, S; Zacco, A; Bontempi, E",J Environ Manage
Medline; PMC,High Levels of CD244 Rather Than CD160 Associate With CD8(+) T-Cell Aging,"Aging leads to functional dysregulation of the immune system, especially T cell defects. Previous studies have shown that the accumulation of co-inhibitory molecules plays an essential role in both T cell exhaustion and aging. In the present study, we showed that CD244 and CD160 were both up-regulated on CD8(+) T cells of elderly individuals. CD244(+)CD160(-) CD8(+) T cells displayed the increased activity of β-GAL, higher production of cytokines, and severe metabolic disorders, which were characteristics of immune aging. Notably, the functional dysregulation associated with aging was reversed by blocking CD244 instead of CD160. Meanwhile, CD244(+)CD160(+) CD8(+) T cells exhibited features of exhaustion, including lower levels of cytokine, impaired proliferation, and intrinsic transcriptional regulation, compared to CD244(+)CD160(-) population.

WHO,Comparison of CLEIA and ELISA for SARS-CoV-2 Virus Antibodies after First and Second Dose Vaccinations with the BNT162b2 mRNA Vaccine,"The global severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has required rapid action to control its spread and vaccines are a fundamental solution to this pandemic. The development of rapid and reliable serological tests to monitor the antibody response to coronavirus disease vaccines is necessary for post-vaccination immune responses. Therefore, in this study, anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody titers after the first and second doses were monitored using two different measurement systems, a highly sensitive analytical platform of chemiluminescent enzyme immunoassay (CLEIA) and an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Our study included 121 participants who received two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Both methods show significant increase in anti-spike protein IgG antibody levels one week after the first vaccination, and then reached at a plateau at week five (week two after the second dose), with a 3.8 ×103-fold rise in CLEIA and a 22-fold rise in ELISA. CLEIA and ELISA showed a good correlation in the high titer range, >10 binding antibody unit (BAU)/mL. Both methods detected higher IgG antibody levels in females compared with male participants after the second vaccination, while CLEIA exhibits the sex difference after the first dose. Thus, our study showed better performance of CLEIA over ELISA in sensitivity, especially in the low concentration range, however ELISA was also useful in the high titer range (>10 BAU/mL) corresponding to the level seen several weeks after the first vaccination.",2022,"Ashenagar, Mohammad Said Matsumoto Akiko Sakai Hironori Tokiya Mikiko Hara Megumi Hirota Yoshio",Vaccines
WHO,Evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 in Human Semen and Effect on Total Sperm Number: A Prospective Observational Study,"PURPOSE: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has created a surge of research to help better understand the breadth of possible sequelae. However, little is known regarding the impact on semen parameters and fertility potential. We sought to investigate for presence of viral RNA in semen of men with SARS-CoV-2 infection and to evaluate its effect on semen parameters in ejaculate. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We prospectively recruited thirty men diagnosed with acute SARS-CoV-2 infection using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of pharyngeal swab specimens. Semen samples were collected from each individual using mailed kits. Follow-up semen samples were done with mailed kits or in-person in office setting. Semen analysis and PCR was performed after samples were received. RESULTS: Thirty semen samples from recovered men were obtained 11-64 days after testing positive for SAR-CoV-2 infection. The median duration between positive SAR-CoV-2 test and semen collection was 37 days (interquartile range [IQR]=23). The median total sperm number (TSN) in ejaculate was 12.5 million (IQR=52.1). When compared with age-matched SARS-CoV-2(-) men, TSN was lower among SARS-CoV-2(+) men (p=0.0024). Five men completed a follow-up sperm analysis (median 3 months) and had a median TSN of 18 million (IQR=21.6). No RNA was detected by means of RT-PCR in the semen in 16 samples tested. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 infection, though not detected in semen of recovered men, can affect TSN in ejaculate in the acute setting.

Mean size of the GA lesions did not differ significantly between baseline and study end (29 212±22 887 pixels vs 29 300±22 905 pixels; p=0.59) nor did the mean perimetric mean defect (-10.3±5.9 dB vs 12.0±8.8 dB; p=0.35) or the electroretinographical b-wave amplitude (44.53±31.7 µV vs 64.5±25.5 µV; p=0.12). After a second injection 4 weeks after the first injection, one of two patients developed a cystoid macular oedema in association with an induced incomplete posterior vitreous detachment. It persisted for 3 weeks. Visual acuity in this eye improved from 1.0 logMAR at baseline to 0.80 logMAR at study end. CONCLUSIONS Except for one eye with temporary, self-resolving cystoid macular oedema, single and repeated intravitreal applications of EGF (0.75 µg) in patients with GA did not lead to intraocular inflammations or any observed intraocular side effect.

Medline; PMC,Circulating Type I Interferon Levels in the Early Phase of COVID-19 Are Associated With the Development of Respiratory Failure,"BACKGROUND: The role of type I interferons (IFNs) in the early phase of COVID-19 remains unclear. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the relationship between IFN-I levels in patients with COVID-19 and clinical presentation, SARS-CoV-2 viral load, and other major pro-inflammatory cytokines. METHODS: This prospective observational study recruited patients hospitalized with COVID-19. The levels of interferon-alpha (IFN-α), interferon-beta (IFN-β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and C-X-C motif chemokine ligand (CXCL10) within 5 days after symptom onset were measured using an ELISA, in serum from blood collected within 5 days after the onset of symptoms. The SARS-CoV-2 viral load was determined via qPCR using nasal-swab specimens and serum. RESULTS: The study enrolled 50 patients with COVID-19. IFN-α levels were significantly higher in patients who presented with pneumonia or developed hypoxemic respiratory failure (p < 0.001). Furthermore, IFN-α levels were associated with viral load in nasal-swab specimens and RNAemia (p < 0.05). In contrast, there was no significant association between IFN-β levels and the presence of pneumonia or RNAemia, despite showing a stronger association with nasal-swab viral load (p < 0.001). Correlation analysis showed that the serum levels of IFN-α significantly correlated with those of IFN-β, IL-6, and CXCL10, while the levels of IFN-β did not correlate with those of IL-6 or CXCL10. CONCLUSIONS: Serum IFN-I levels in the early phase of SARS-CoV-2 infection were higher in patients who developed hypoxemic respiratory failure. The association between IFN-α, IL-6, and CXCL10 may reflect the systemic immune response against SARS-CoV-2 invasion into pulmonary circulation, which might be an early predictor of respiratory failure due to COVID-19.",2022-02-14,"Nagaoka, Kentaro; Kawasuji, Hitoshi; Murai, Yushi; Kaneda, Makito; Ueno, Akitoshi; Miyajima, Yuki; Fukui, Yasutaka; Morinaga, Yoshitomo; Yamamoto, Yoshihiro",Front Immunol

Medline; PMC,Vitamin D Supplementation in COVID-19 Patients: A Clinical Case Series,"BACKGROUND: Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has infected more than 4.4 million people and caused more than 300,000 deaths partly through acute respiratory distress syndrome with propensity to affect African American and Hispanic communities disproportionately. Patients with worse outcomes have exhibited higher blood plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines. Activation of the vitamin D receptor expressed on immune cells has been shown to directly reduce the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6, and indirectly affect C-reactive protein. AREAS OF UNCERTAINTY: The significance of the vitamin D pathway in patients diagnosed with COVID-19. THERAPEUTIC INNOVATION: Vitamin D supplementation in patients after diagnosis of COVID-19. PATIENTS AND PHARMACOLOGICAL INTERVENTIONS: We report 4 vitamin D deficient patients diagnosed with COVID-19 in April 2020 who were provided with either cholecalciferol of 1000 IU daily (standard dose) or ergocalciferol 50,000 IU daily for 5 days (high dose) as part of supplementation. CLINICAL OUTCOMES: Patients that received a high dose of vitamin D supplementation achieved normalization of vitamin D levels and improved clinical recovery evidenced by shorter lengths of stay, lower oxygen requirements, and a reduction in inflammatory marker status. CONCLUSIONS: Vitamin D supplementation may serve as a viable alternative for curtailing acute respiratory distress syndrome in patients in underserved communities where resources to expensive and sought-after medications may be scarce. Randomized clinical trials will serve as an appropriate vessel to validate the efficacy of the therapeutic regimen and dissection of the pathway.",2020-08-13,"Ohaegbulam, Kim C.; Swalih, Mohamed; Patel, Pranavkumar; Smith, Miriam A.; Perrin, Richard",Am J Ther
Medline; PMC,Protocol: A mixed methods evaluation of an IPS program to increase employment and well-being for people with long-term experience of complex barriers in Vancouver’s downtown and DTES,"BACKGROUND: Employment improves mental health and well-being by providing financial security, daily structure, a sense of identity and purpose, and social engagement. However, securing and sustaining employment is exceptionally challenging for vulnerable populations who experience persistent and multiple barriers, such as mental illness, homelessness, food and housing insecurity, and marginalization. Evidence-based supported employment programs, most notably individual placement and support (IPS) are becoming a more common approach for addressing the needs of these high-risk individuals. The aim of this paper is to outline the protocol for evaluating an IPS program in Vancouver’s downtown and Downtown Eastside (DTES). METHODS AND DESIGN: This prospective quasi-experimental study of persons with persistent and multiple barriers to employment will use a mixed-methods approach for evaluating a novel IPS program. The evaluation will consist of survey packages and interviews that will capture outcomes related to employment and well-being, as well as the experiential process of receiving individualized and integrated supports through the IPS program. A mixed-methods approach is appropriate for this study as quantitative data will provide an objective assessment of program impacts on employment and well-being outcomes over time, while qualitative data will provide an in-depth understanding of continued barriers and experiences. DISCUSSION: The results from this evaluation will contribute evidence within a local British Columbian (BC) context that may increase access to meaningful employment for those with long-term experience of complex barriers to employment. Further, the findings will support continued improvements, and guide decision-making around practices and policy for future implementation of IPS and employment supports across BC.",2021-12-16,"Kwan, Amanda; Morris, Jonny; Barbic, Skye P.",PLoS One

Medline; PMC,The Interaction of Water-Soluble Nitroxide Radicals with Photosystem II,"In this work, we investigated the redox transients of a number of water-soluble spin labels upon their interactions with Photosystem II (PS II) core complexes isolated from spinach leaves. We have found that the reactivity of nitroxide radicals, determined by the rate of their reduction upon illumination of PS II, depends on the chemical structure of radicals and the capability of their coming close to low-potential redox centers of photoactive PS II complexes. An enhanced capability of nitroxide radicals to accept electrons from PS II correlates with their chemical structure. Nitroxide radicals NTI (2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-4-nitromethylene-3-imidazolidine-N-oxyl) and Tacet (4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl-acetate), containing polar groups, appear to be most efficient acceptors of electrons donated by PS II compared to neutral (TEMPOL, 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-1-oxyl) or positively charged (Tamine, 4-amino-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-l-oxyl) spin labels. We assume that enhanced reactivities of polar nitroxide radicals, NTI and Tacet, are determined (1) by their relatively high redox potentials, providing the possibility to accept electrons from PS II, and (2) by their affinities to the closest binding sites on the surface of PS II in the vicinity of the primary plastoquinone acceptor PQ(A) (12–14 Å) or/and in the intraprotein cavity for the secondary plastoquinone PQ(B) (~ 22 Å).",2021-09-09,"Trubitsin, B.

Medline,[Analysis of the changes and characteristics of pediatric outpatient visits in a general hospital in Beijing before and after the COVID-19 pandemic].,"OBJECTIVE To analyze the changes and characteristics of pediatric outpatient visits in a general hospital before and after the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) epidemic. METHODS Based on the registration data of pediatric outpatient visits in the information system (HIS)of Beijing Tsinghua Changgung Hospital, from January 1 2018 to December 31 2020, aged 0 to 16 years, we analyzed the changes of outpatient visits before and after the epidemic, focusing on respiratory infection including influenza. The relationship between the outpatient visits and age and quarterly distribution were also studied. RESULTS (1) Respiratory infection accounted for the majority of outpatient visits in 2018 and 2019 (60.6% and 60.5%, respectively). Non-respiratory infection accounted for the main proportion of outpatient visits in 2020, while respiratory infection accounted for only 47.4%. Annual respiratory infection visits, respiratory infectious diseases visits especially influenza visits all decreased significantly in 2020 compared with that in 2018 and 2019 (P < 0.05). (2)Respiratory infection visits were highest in the infant group, lowest in the school age group (P < 0.05) and highest in the fourth quarter each year. It decreased significantly in the second quarter of 2020 with statistical significance when compared with the other quarters of 2020(P < 0.05). (3)Influenza accounted for the highest proportion of respiratory infectious diseases visits in each year. It was highest in first quarter, which was significantly different from the other quarters of the year (P < 0.05). There were different distributions of influenza visits throughout 2018 and 2019, while it was only distributed in the first quarter and 99% in January in 2020. CONCLUSION The respiratory infection and influenza visits have decreased significantly in our pediatric outpatient department after the COVID-19 epidemic, which is considered closely related to the lifestyle and personal protection after the epidemic. It is recommended that health education on respiratory infection and influenza prevention should be strengthened, especially in winter and spring, to promote the development of good respiratory and hand hygiene habits.",2021-10-18,"Meng, H; Ji, L N; Huang, J; Chao, S; Zhou, J W; Li, X J; Yin, X M; Fan, L R",Beijing da xue xue bao.

Medline; PMC,"NIMO-CKD-UK: a real-world, observational study of iron isomaltoside in patients with iron deficiency anaemia and chronic kidney disease","BACKGROUND: Intravenous iron is often used to treat iron deficiency anaemia in non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (ND-CKD), but the optimal dosing regimen remains unclear. We evaluated the impact of high- versus low-dose intravenous iron isomaltoside on the probability of retreatment with intravenous iron in iron-deficient ND-CKD patients. METHODS: This real-world, prospective, observational study collected data from 256 ND-CKD patients treated for anaemia in the UK. Following an initial course of iron isomaltoside, patients were followed for ≥12 months. Iron dose and the need for retreatment were determined at the investigators’ discretion. The primary study outcome was the need for retreatment at 52 weeks compared between patients who received >1000 mg of iron during Course 1 and those who received ≤1000 mg. Safety was evaluated through adverse drug reactions. RESULTS: The probability of retreatment at Week 52 was significantly lower in the >1000 mg iron group (n = 58) versus the ≤1000 mg group (n = 198); hazard ratio (95% confidence interval [CI]): 0.46 (0.20, 0.91); p = 0.012. Mean (95% CI) haemoglobin increased by 6.58 (4.94, 8.21) g/L in the ≤1000 mg group and by 10.59 (7.52, 13.66) g/L in the >1000 mg group (p = 0.024). Changes in other blood and iron parameters were not significantly different between the two groups. Administering >1000 mg of iron isomaltoside saved 8.6 appointments per 100 patients compared to ≤1000 mg. No serious adverse drug reactions were reported. Of the patients who received ≤1000 mg of iron in this study, 82.3% were eligible for a dose >1000 mg. CONCLUSIONS: The >1000 mg iron isomaltoside regimen reduced the probability of retreatment, achieved a greater haemoglobin response irrespective of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent treatment, and reduced the total number of appointments required, compared to the ≤1000 mg regimen. Many of the patients who received ≤1000 mg of iron were eligible for >1000 mg, indicating that there was considerable underdosing in this study.

Medline,Tripartite-motif protein 30 negatively regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation by modulating reactive oxygen species production.,"The NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome is critical for caspase-1 activation and the proteolytic processing of pro-IL-1β. However, the mechanism that regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation remains unclear. In this paper, we demonstrate that tripartite-motif protein 30 (TRIM30) negatively regulates NLRP3 inflammasome activation. After stimulation with ATP, an agonist of the NLRP3 inflammasome, knockdown of TRIM30 enhanced caspase-1 activation and increased production of IL-1β in both J774 cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages. Similarly with ATP, knockdown of TRIM30 increased caspase-1 activation and IL-1β production triggered by other NLRP3 inflammasome agonists, including nigericin, monosodium urate, and silica. Production of reactive oxygen species was increased in TRIM30 knockdown cells, and its increase was required for enhanced NLRP3 inflammasome activation, because antioxidant treatment blocked excess IL-1β production. Conversely, overexpression of TRIM30 attenuated reactive oxygen species production and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Finally, in a crystal-induced NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent peritonitis model, monosodium urate-induced neutrophil flux and IL-1β production was reduced significantly in TRIM30 transgenic mice as compared with that in their nontransgenic littermates. Taken together, our results indicate that TRIM30 is a negative regulator of NLRP3 inflammasome activation and provide insights into the role of TRIM30 in maintaining inflammatory responses.",2010,"Hu, Yu; Mao, Kairui; Zeng, Yan; Chen, Shuzhen; Tao, Zhiyun; Yang, Chen; Sun, Shuhui; Wu, Xiaodong; Meng, Guangxun; Sun, Bing",Journal of immunology

Medline; PMC,"Impact of AmaTea® Max on physiological measures and gaming performance in active gamers: A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized study","BACKGROUND AND AIM: The activity of “gaming” has increased greatly in popularity in recent years, with many gamers using nutritional supplements to aid mood and gaming performance. We evaluated the impact of AmaTea(®) Max (referred to as AmaTea(®) throughout; a patented dietary supplement consisting of a blend of caffeine and polyphenol antioxidants), compared to both caffeine and a placebo, on gaming and cognitive performance in active gamers. METHODS: Subjects reported to the lab on three occasions, separated by approximately 1 week. On each day, they had baseline measurements taken and then played the game Fortnite for four 1-h periods. Measures of cognitive performance, gaming performance, heart rate and blood pressure (BP), and blood cortisol were measured before and at selected times following gameplay. RESULTS: Neither caffeine nor AmaTea(®) impacted gaming or cognitive performance in a statistically significant manner. However, a trend (P=0.075) was noted for the condition effect for kills/match, with values 21% higher for AmaTea(®) (1.84) compared to placebo (1.51), and 12% higher for AmaTea(®) compared to caffeine (1.63). Subjective mood was relatively unaffected, although a condition effect was noted for jittery (P=0.05), with values lower for placebo than for caffeine (P=0.02). BP was minimally elevated with both AmaTea(®) and caffeine, while cortisol followed the normal diurnal variation and was lower for placebo than AmaTea(®) and caffeine. CONCLUSION: AmaTea(®) modestly increased kills/match during gameplay. It is possible that a different gaming stimulus, varied time of gameplay, or different dosage of the supplement may have yielded different results. RELEVANCE FOR SUBJECTS: Active gamers who seek to use a dietary supplement for purposes of gaming performance may benefit slightly from ingestion of AmaTea(®) before gameplay while experiencing greater vigor and lower fatigue as compared to placebo.",2022-03-01,"Bloomer, Richard J.; Martin, Keith R.; Pence, Jacquelyn C.",J Clin Transl Res
Medline,Predicting fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated children under general anaesthesia using dynamic parameters and transthoracic echocardiography.,"BACKGROUND Dynamic variables are accurate predictors of fluid responsiveness in adults undergoing mechanical ventilation. They can be determined using respiratory variation in aortic flow peak velocity (▵Vpeak), arterial pulse pressure [▵PP and pulse pressure variation (PPV)], or plethysmographic waveform amplitude [▵POP and pleth variability index (PVI)]. These indices have not been validated in children. We studied the ability of these variables to predict fluid responsiveness in mechanically ventilated children. METHODS All results are expressed as median [median absolute deviation (MAD)]. Thirty mechanically ventilated children were studied after undergoing general anaesthesia. Mechanical ventilation was maintained with a tidal volume of 10 ml kg(-1) of body weight. ▵PP, PPV, ▵POP, PVI, ▵Vpeak, and aortic velocity-time integral were recorded before and after volume expansion (VE). Patients were considered to be responders to VE when the aortic velocity-time integral increased more than 15% after VE. RESULTS VE induced significant changes in ▵PP [13 (MAD 4) to 9 (5)%], PPV [15 (5) to 9 (5)%], ▵POP [15 (10) to 10 (6)%], PVI [13 (6) to 8 (5)%], and ▵Vpeak [16 (9) to 8 (3)%] (P<0.05 for all). Differences in ▵PP, ▵POP, PPV, and PVI did not reach statistical significance. Only ▵Vpeak was significantly different between responders (R) and non-responders (NR) to VE [22 (3) vs 7 (1)%, respectively; P<0.001]. The threshold ▵Vpeak value of 10% allowed discrimination between R and NR. CONCLUSIONS In this study, ▵Vpeak was the most appropriate variable to predict fluid responsiveness.",2011,"Pereira de Souza Neto, E; Grousson, S; Duflo, F; Ducreux, C; Joly, H; Convert, J; Mottolese, C; Dailler, F; Cannesson, M",British journal of anaesthesia
Medline; PMC; WHO,Neutralizing Antibodies and Antibody-Dependent Enhancement in COVID-19: A Perspective,"Antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) is an alternative route of viral entry in the susceptible host cell. In this process, antiviral antibodies enhance the entry access of virus in the cells via interaction with the complement or Fc receptors leading to the worsening of infection. SARS-CoV-2 variants pose a general concern for the efficacy of neutralizing antibodies that may fail to neutralize infection, raising the possibility of a more severe form of COVID-19. Data from various studies on respiratory viruses raise the speculation that antibodies elicited against SARS-CoV-2 and during COVID-19 recovery could potentially exacerbate the infection through ADE at sub-neutralizing concentrations; this may contribute to disease pathogenesis. It is, therefore, of utmost importance to study the effectiveness of the anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in COVID-19-infected subjects. Theoretically, ADE remains a general concern for the efficacy of antibodies elicited during infection, most notably in convalescent plasma therapy and in response to vaccines where it could be counterproductive.",2022-02-04,"Ajmeriya, Swati; Kumar, Amit; Karmakar, Subhradip; Rana, Shweta; Singh, Harpreet",J Indian Inst Sci

This order belongs to a group referred to as early-diverging fungi that are characterized by high levels of N6-methyldeoxy adenine (6mA) in their genome with dense 6mA clusters associated with actively expressed genes. AlkB enzymes can act as demethylases of 6mA in DNA, with the most remarkable eukaryotic examples being mammalian ALKBH1 and Caenorhabditis elegans NMAD-1. The Mucor lusitanicus (formerly M. circinelloides f. lusitanicus) genome contains one gene, dmt1, and two genes, dmt2 and dmt3, encoding proteins similar to C. elegans NMAD-1 and ALKBH1, respectively. The function of these three genes was analyzed by the generation of single and double deletion mutants for each gene. Multiple processes were studied in the mutants, but defects were only found in single and double deletion mutants for dmt1. In contrast to the wild-type strain, dmt1 mutants showed an increase in 6mA levels during the dimorphic transition, suggesting that 6mA is associated with dimorphism in M. lusitanicus. Furthermore, the spores of dmt1 mutants challenged with macrophages underwent a reduction in polar growth, suggesting that 6mA also has a role during the spore–macrophage interaction that could be important in the infection process.",2021-09-08,"Osorio-Concepción, Macario; Lax, Carlos; Navarro, Eusebio; Nicolás, Francisco E.; Garre, Victoriano",J Fungi (Basel)

WHO,Determining the reliability of rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection in fully vaccinated individuals,"Background Rapid antigen detection tests (RADT) are commonly used as SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests both by medical professionals and laypeople. However, the performance of RADT in vaccinated individuals has not been fully investigated. Objectives RT-qPCR and rapid antigen detection testing were performed to evaluate the performance of the Standard Q COVID-19 Ag Test in detecting SARS-CoV-2 breakthrough infections in vaccinated individuals. Study design Two swab specimens, one for RT-qPCR and one for RADT, were collected from vaccinated individuals in an outpatient clinic. For comparison of RADT performance in vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals, a dataset already published by this group was used as reference. Results A total of 696 samples were tested with both RT-qPCR and RADT that included 692 (99.4%) samples from vaccinated individuals. Of these, 76 (11.0%) samples were detected SARS-CoV-2 positive by RT-qPCR and 45 (6.5%) samples by the Standard Q COVID-19 Ag test. Stratified by Ct values, sensitivity of the RADT was 100.0%, 94.4% and 81.1% for Ct ≤ 20 (n=18), Ct ≤ 25 (n=36) and Ct ≤ 30 (n=53), respectively. Samples with Ct values ≥ 30 (n=23) were not detected. Overall RADT specificity was 99.7% and symptom status did not affect RADT performance. Notably, RADT detected 4 out of 4 samples of probable Omicron variant infection based on single nucleotide polymorphism analysis.

WHO,Exploring the development and maintenance of therapeutic relationships through e-Health support: A narrative analysis of therapist experiences,"Objective: Amid COVID-19 disruptions, e-therapy has become even more essential and has rapidly expanded across statutory, private and third sectors to meet growing demands for digital mental health support. A challenge in digital therapeutic care is how to develop and maintain a supportive, collaborative therapeutic relationship, built upon mutual trust and respect;intrinsic values of relationships that are often implied through complex non-verbal cues. Online practitioners are eager to learn how to adapt to online delivery, although platform-specific training is limited. The aim of the current study was to focus upon the therapist experience of online therapeutic relationships with young people, exploring a range of factors through their perspectives, including the impact of anonymity. Methods: Eight e-therapy practitioners were recruited from Kooth, an online mental health service. Narrative interviews undertaken via Skype facilitated reflective conversational one-to-one discussions, based upon the practitioners’ individual experiences, led by the interviewee. Following transcription and anonymisation, a narrative analysis was undertaken to explore participants’ experiences, perspectives and reflections. Results: Four analytic layers arose from the narratives, which explored the challenging learning experience of translating existing therapeutic skills to online working, rapidly building therapeutic relationships, managing risk in the online therapeutic relationship, and techniques for maintaining a digital therapeutic relationship. Conclusion: The study provides novel insights into the flexibility and adjustments therapists can make to improve online interventions and delivery through the development and maintenance of positive therapeutic relationships. Recommendations are also made in relation to platform-specific training, communicative adaptations, risk management and practitioner support.",2021,"Wood, M. J.; Wilson, H. M. N.; Parry, S.

WHO,The influence of classroom seating arrangement on children’s cognitive processes in primary school: The role of individual variables,"To date, despite the great debate regarding the best seating arrangement for learning in classrooms, no empirical studies have examined the direct effects of different seating arrangements on children’s cognitive processes. This is particularly important nowadays that the COVID-19 measures include maintaining distance in the classroom. Aim of this study was experimentally investigating the effect of changing the seating arrangement (clusters vs. rows and columns), on logical reasoning, creativity and theory of mind, in children attending primary school. Furthermore, some individual characteristics (e.g., gender, loneliness, popularity) were analysed as potential moderators. Results on 77 participants showed that, when children were seated in rows and columns, their score in logical reasoning was globally higher. Furthermore, when seated in rows and columns, girls showed a better performance in the theory of mind, and lonelier children performed better in theory of mind and creativity. This on field experimental study suggests the importance of considering both the nature of the task and children’s individual characteristics when deciding on a seating arrangement in the classroom.",2020,"Tobia, Valentina Sacchi Simona Cerina Veronica Manca Sara Fornara Ferdinando",

PMC,Identifying researcher learning needs to develop online training for UK researchers working with administrative data: CENTRIC training,"BACKGROUND: The use of administrative data in health and social science research continues to expand, with increased availability of data and interest from funders. Researchers, however, continue to experience delays in access, storage and sharing of administrative data. Training opportunities are limited and typically specific to individual data providers or focussed on the analytical aspects of working with administrative data. The CENTRIC study was funded by the Information Commissioners Office, with the aim of developing a broader training curriculum for researchers working with administrative data in the UK. METHODS: A mixed-methods design informed curriculum content, including surveys with researchers, focus group discussions with data providers and workshops with members of the public. Researchers were identified from relevant administrative data networks and invited to participate in an online survey identifying training needs. Data providers were approached with a request to input to a face-to-face or online meeting with two members of the research team about their experiences of working with researchers. Data were analysed within the broad framework of the interview schedule, free text responses in the survey were analysed thematically. RESULTS: 107 researchers responded to the online survey and four data providers participated in the focus groups. We identified five main themes, relating to research training needs for UK researchers working with administrative data: communication; timelines; changes & amendments; future-proofing applications; and, the availability of training and support. Data providers either provided additional evidence on these learning needs or ways to address identified challenges. Six modules were developed addressing these training needs. Quotes from the survey and focus groups are used anonymously in the online training modules. CONCLUSION: The CENTRIC online training curriculum was launched in September 2020 and is available, free of charge for UK researchers. CENTRIC specifically addresses commonly identified training needs of researchers working with administrative data.",2022-02-02,"Lugg-Widger, Fiona; Munnery, Kim; Townson, Julia; Trubey, Rob; Robling, Michael",
WHO,"Secondary attack rate of COVID-19 in household contacts in the Winnipeg Health Region, Canada","OBJECTIVES: Understanding important transmission parameters, such as secondary attack rates, can help in strategizing, prioritizing, and planning interventions to curb morbidity and mortality due to COVID-19. Early reports suggest the risk of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (the pathogen that causes COVID-19 disease) is high among household contacts of cases. The purpose of this analysis was to determine the household transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in residents of the Winnipeg Health Region. METHODS: We extracted information on COVID-19 cases and their household contacts from the regional public health surveillance database and used this dataset to calculate secondary attack rates. RESULTS: We included 381 individuals from 102 unique households (102 primary cases and 279 household contacts). A total of 41 contacts from 25 households became secondary cases in the 14 days since last unprotected exposure to the primary case, resulting in a secondary attack rate of 14.7% (95% CI: 10.5-18.8).

WHO,Learning from 2020: How the Challenges of Remote Teaching Reinforce the Need for Care-Informed Pedagogy,"How did instructors design their sociology courses for remote teaching during the 2020?2021 academic year, and what challenges did they face in teaching those courses? To answer these questions, we surveyed lead instructors and graduate teaching assistants (n?=?77) in the Sociology Department at the University of Michigan, supplemented by interviews with students and our experiences as remote course consultants. Through this case study, we found that instructors cited increased workload and lack of connection as challenges with remote teaching, in addition to pandemic-related struggles. Most instructors reported using either synchronous or a mix of synchronous and asynchronous instruction in course design, incorporating both formative and summative assessments, and implementing communication and community-building strategies to establish connections with and among students. We argue that these challenges and course designs highlight the importance of care-informed pedagogy to not only remote teaching in 2020?2021 but also sociology instruction in general.",2021,"Hess, Kimberly McAuliffe Erin L.; Gleckman-Krut, Miriam Shapiro Shoshana",Teaching Sociology

In this single-center cohort study, comprising 300 participants, two phone interviews were conducted (2-week and 1-month after hospitalization) and symptoms were queried with a standardized form. This form included musculoskeletal symptoms and other COVID-19 symptoms. Considering all symptoms (musculoskeletal and other), 100.0%, 86.7%, and 72.0% of patients reported one or more symptoms, at hospitalization, 2-week, and 1-month, respectively. Considering only musculoskeletal symptoms, 92.3%, 72.7%, and 56.3% of patients reported any musculoskeletal symptom at hospitalization, 2-week, and 1-month, respectively. The musculoskeletal symptoms were fatigue (44.3% of patients reported), back pain (22.7%), arthralgia (22.0%), myalgia (21.0%), low back pain (16.3%), and neck pain (10.3%); the other symptoms were shortness of breath (26.3%), loss of taste (15.0%), cough (14.0%), loss of smell (12.3%), loss of appetite (10.3%), headache (8.7%), sore throat (3.0%), diarrhea (1.3%), dizziness (1.3%), and fever (0.3%) at 1-month. Increasing BMI was associated with higher odds of persistence of fatigue (OR: 1.08, 1.03 to 1.13), myalgia (OR: 1.08, 1.01 to 1.14), and arthralgia (OR: 1.07, 1.02 to 1.14, p = 0.012) at 1-month. Nearly three-quarters reported one or more symptoms, with more than half of patients reported any musculoskeletal symptom at 1 month. The most common musculoskeletal symptom was fatigue, followed by back pain, arthralgia, myalgia, low back pain, and neck pain. The persistence of fatigue, myalgia, and arthralgia was related to BMI. The study results increase our understanding of the spectrum of COVID-19, which, in turn, may lead to more efficient and better care for COVID-19 survivors.

WHO,Exploring the association of androgen modulation therapy among men hospitalized with covid19: A retrospective observational study,"INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: While primarily associated with prostate cancer pathogenesis, TMPRSS2 has recently been identified as a co-receptor for ACE2, the target protein used by SARSCoV2 for viral entry. This protein is primarily regulated by the androgen receptor, and this mechanism may partly explain the disproportionate burden of disease among males. We hypothesized that the use of androgen modulation therapies (AMT) such as 5-a-reductase inhibitors (5-ARI) and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) may affect inpatient outcomes among hospitalized men with COVID-19. METHODS: In a single-center retrospective analysis in a large urban hospital system, hospitalized males with laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 and a history of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and/or prostate cancer was identified from February to June 2020. Men were then stratified by use of specific AMT (ADT or 5- ARI). Baseline patient and hospital characteristics were analyzed using descriptive statistics, and multivariable regression models were used to explore the association of AMT with inpatient mortality, length of hospital stay (LOS), and other ICU outcomes (ICU admission, ICU Length of Stay, Non-Invasive Mechanical Ventilation, Intubation, and ARDS). RESULTS: A total of 396 inpatients were identified, with 130 (32.8%) having prior use of AMT. Of these, a large majority used 5-ARI (n=122, 93.8%). Mean (SD) age of patients was higher for those using AMT (76.5 (10.7) vs. 71.1 (11.8) years;p<0.001). No significant differences were identified in AMT use by race, body mass index, smoking status, or Charlson Comorbidity Index. Despite adjustment for these factors, AMT use was not associated with ICU admission, ventilation status, length of ICU stay, or length of hospital stay. However, a non-significant trend of decreased mortality was identified with the use of AMT (adjusted OR: 0.56;95% CI: 0.29e1.02;p=0.06) (Table 1). CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary analysis suggests that AMT does not appear to improve inpatient outcomes among hospitalized males with COVID-19. The non-significant trend of decreased inpatient mortality, however, may be attributed to insufficient power. Future research with large sample sizes may uncover potential benefits of androgen modulation on COVID19 pathogenesis and outcomes.",2021,"Ha, A.; Punjani, N.; Wang, V.; Caputo, J.; Wallace, B.

This study explores a specific phenotype of COVID-19-associated hyperinflammation (COV-HI), and its associations with escalation of respiratory support and survival. METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled consecutive inpatients (aged ≥18 years) admitted to University College London Hospitals and Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals in the UK with PCR-confirmed COVID-19 during the first wave of community-acquired infection. Demographic data, laboratory tests, and clinical status were recorded from the day of admission until death or discharge, with a minimum follow-up time of 28 days. We defined COV-HI as a C-reactive protein concentration greater than 150 mg/L or doubling within 24 h from greater than 50 mg/L, or a ferritin concentration greater than 1500 μg/L. Respiratory support was categorised as oxygen only, non-invasive ventilation, and intubation. Initial and repeated measures of hyperinflammation were evaluated in relation to the next-day risk of death or need for escalation of respiratory support (as a combined endpoint), using a multi-level logistic regression model. FINDINGS: We included 269 patients admitted to one of the study hospitals between March 1 and March 31, 2020, among whom 178 (66%) were eligible for escalation of respiratory support and 91 (34%) patients were not eligible. Of the whole cohort, 90 (33%) patients met the COV-HI criteria at admission. Despite having a younger median age and lower median Charlson Comorbidity Index scores, a higher proportion of patients with COV-HI on admission died during follow-up (36 [40%] of 90 patients) compared with the patients without COV-HI on admission (46 [26%] of 179). Among the 178 patients who were eligible for full respiratory support, 65 (37%) met the definition for COV-HI at admission, and 67 (74%) of the 90 patients whose respiratory care was escalated met the criteria by the day of escalation. Meeting the COV-HI criteria was significantly associated with the risk of next-day escalation of respiratory support or death (hazard ratio 2·24 [95% CI 1·62–2·87]) after adjustment for age, sex, and comorbidity. INTERPRETATION: Associations between elevated inflammatory markers, escalation of respiratory support, and survival in people with COVID-19 indicate the existence of a high-risk inflammatory phenotype. COV-HI might be useful to stratify patient groups in trial design.

Medline,[Effectiveness of the implementation of clinical-epidemiological management during Covid-19 in a medium-long-stay hospital.],"OBJECTIVE The effects of the Covid-19 health emergency have demonstrated the high vulnerability of people residing in medium and long-stay centers, with high mortality rates. Little data is available about contingency protocols to minimize the spread of the virus in these centers. The goal of this study was to describe the clinical and epidemiological features of patients affected by SARS-CoV-2 and the preventive and management measures adopted at the National Hospital for Paraplegics (Toledo, Castilla-La Mancha, Spain) to minimize the risk of transmission of Covid-19. METHODS A team of specialists in Preventive and Internal Medicine established a protocol for active surveillance, identification of suspected and confirmed cases, and follow-up of contacts. Also, a Unit for the care of confirmed cases was created with personnel specifically trained in Covid-19, to achieve better patient care and optimize the available resources. Descriptive statistical measures have been used to analyze the data. RESULTS The prevalence of Covid-19 was 12.2%, with a cumulative incidence of 8.2%. After the protocol was established, control of the disease was achieved without hospital transmission after its application. Due to the alarm generated at the start of the pandemic, up to 45% of the requested RT-PCRs did not meet the criteria of the Ministry of Health, all of which were negative. The clinical characteristics of our patients differed slightly from those observed in other studies published in the general population, with cough and asthenia being the most frequent symptoms, present in 69.2% and 38.5%, respectively. 100% of the infected patients did not present complications that required assistance in the Intensive Care Unit. CONCLUSIONS With the application of preventive and organizational actions, we consider that we have presented a low incidence of those infected. The preparation of protocols and their supervision is essential for the rapid identification of cases and optimization of the tests requested. Despite being a medium and long-stay hospital, we have not presented any mortality or complications that required admission to the Intensive Care Unit.",2020-07-13,"Ruiz Moruno, Antonio José; Rodríguez Cola, Miguel; Jiménez Velasco, Irena; Ruíz Delgado, Rosa María; González Rubio, Alicia",Revista espanola de salud publica

WHO,New-onset anosmia and ageusia in adult patients diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection,"OBJECTIVES: We investigated the prevalence of anosmia and ageusia in adult patients with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of infection with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). METHODS: This was a retrospective observational analysis of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 admitted to hospital or managed in the community and their household contacts across a London population during the period March 1st to April 1st, 2020. Symptomatology and duration were extracted from routinely collected clinical data and follow-up telephone consultations. Descriptive statistics were used. RESULTS: Of 386 patients, 141 (92 community patients, 49 discharged inpatients) were included for analysis; 77/141 (55%) reported anosmia and ageusia, nine reported only ageusia and three only anosmia. The median onset of anosmia in relation to onset of SARS-CoV-2 disease (COVID-19) symptoms (as defined by the Public Health England case definition) was 4 days (interquartile range (IQR) 5). Median duration of anosmia was 8 days (IQR 16). Median duration of COVID-19 symptoms in community patients was 10 days (IQR 8) versus 18 days (IQR 13.5) in admitted patients. As of April 1, 45 patients had ongoing COVID-19 symptoms and/or anosmia; 107/141 (76%) patients had household contacts, and of 185 non-tested household contacts 79 (43%) had COVID-19 symptoms with 46/79 (58%) reporting anosmia. Six household contacts had anosmia only. CONCLUSIONS: Over half of the positive patients reported anosmia and ageusia, suggesting that these should be added to the case definition and used to guide self-isolation protocols.

WHO,Face masks in the general healthy population. Scientific and ethical issues,"In most European countries, facemasks use is recommended or mandatory in enclosed spaces where physical distancing is not possible. In Spain, this measure was first extended to open public spaces and later made mandatory regardless of whether or not the interpersonal safety distance can be kept. At present, there is no evidence on the effectiveness of universal masking of healthy people in the community to prevent infection with respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV-2. The mandatory use of masks poses some ethical questions. Firstly, it entails a paternalistic action. Secondly, application of the principle of precaution becomes questionable when there is no clear benefit-risk relationship. Thirdly, compulsoriness can interfere with equity of public health actions. Fourthly, it can result in social stigma and discrimination against those who do not wear one, even though they well may have good reasons for doing so. Lastly, this measure may generate confusion in the population, along with an altered perception of the risk. The World Health Organization recommends its use in public places with a high potential risk of transmission and where other prevention measures, such as physical distancing, are not possible. Mandatory use of masks in public open spaces, regardless of the risk of transmission or of whether or not the interpersonal safety distance can be kept, is an intrusive measure that restricts individual freedoms, and would not appear to be justified on the basis of available scientific evidence.

PMC,Decolonizing drug policy,"This paper reviews evidence of how drug control has been used to uphold colonial power structures in select countries. It demonstrates the racist and xenophobic impact of drug control policy and proposes a path to move beyond oppressive systems and structures. The ‘colonization of drug control’ refers to the use of drug control by states in Europe and America to advance and sustain the systematic exploitation of people, land and resources and the racialized hierarchies, which were established under colonial control and continue to dominate today. Globally, Black, Brown and Indigenous peoples are disproportionately targeted for drug law enforcement and face discrimination across the criminal system. These communities face higher arrest, prosecution and incarceration rates for drug offenses than other communities, such as majority populations, despite similar rates of drug use and selling among (and between) different races. Current drug policies have contributed to an increase in drug-related deaths, overdoses and sustained transnational criminal enterprises at the expense of the lives of people who use drugs, their families and greater society. This review provides further evidence of the need to reform the current system. It outlines a three-pillared approach to rebuilding drug policy in a way that supports health, dignity and human rights, consisting of: (1) the decriminalization of drugs and their use; (2) an end to the mass incarceration of people who use drugs; (3) the redirection of funding away from ineffective and punitive drug control and toward health and social programs.",2021-11-27,"Daniels, Colleen; Aluso, Aggrey; Burke-Shyne, Naomi; Koram, Kojo; Rajagopalan, Suchitra; Robinson, Imani; Shelly, Shaun; Shirley-Beavan, Sam; Tandon, Tripti",Harm Reduct J

In this research paper, we aimed to study the perceptions of women in Jordan during the pandemic regarding fertility behavior, the desire to use assisted reproductive technology (ART) and the awareness and beliefs of potential risks related to conception. Methods: A validated online-based questionnaire was distributed to women from April–May 2020, Statistical analysis was performed using the statistical software SPSS version 22 and R software (2020); p values ≤ 0.05 were considered statistically significant. Results: The total number of participants was 814 women, with 78.2% of the participants (58.7% fertile and 76.6% infertile) believing that pregnancy during the COVID-19 pandemic could be risky. Among them, 16% and 40%, respectively, were trying to conceive during the pandemic, and 97.4% and 89.9%, respectively, were not willing to use ART if needed during the pandemic.

Medline; PMC,The Effect of Breathing Exercise Using Bubble Blower on Anxiety and Pain during Inferior Alveolar Nerve Block in Children Aged 7 to 10 Years: A Crossover Randomized Clinical Trial,"INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of breathing exercise using bubble blower on anxiety and pain during inferior alveolar nerve block (IANB) in children aged 7 to 10 years. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this randomized crossover clinical trial, thirty-five children with moderate to severe anxiety requiring bilateral pulp therapy of mandibular primary molars were enrolled. Based on random lists, 18 children received the BE + IANB and 17 children received a routine IANB at the first session. This trend became reverse at the second visit for each child. Anxiety was measured using Facial Image Scale (FIS), blood pressure, and pulse rate. Face Leg Activity Cry Consolability (FLACC) scale and Wong–Baker Facial Pain Scale (WBFPS) were used for pain measurement. The Paired Samples Test, Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test, and Interclass Correlation Coefficient were used for data analysis. RESULTS: The means of FLACC, WBFPS, FIS, blood pressure, and pulse rate were higher at the control visit. However, these differences were statistically significant only for FLACC scale and WBFPS (P value <0.05). In subgroup analysis, only girls and children without any previous dental treatment showed significant differences in FLACC scale and WBFPS between the control and bubble blower side (P value <0.05). CONCLUSION: Breathing exercise using a bubble blower may be an efficient distraction and relaxation method to decrease pain of 7- to 10-year-old children with moderate to severe anxiety during inferior alveolar nerve block. However, anxiety levels were lower when applying BE, and the differences were not statistically significant.",2022-01-17,"Bahrololoomi, Zahra; Sadeghiyeh, Tahereh; Rezaei, Maedeh; Maghsoudi, Nahid",Pain Res Manag
Medline; PMC,Coalescent inference for infectious disease: meta-analysis of hepatitis C,"Genetic analysis of pathogen genomes is a powerful approach to investigating the population dynamics and epidemic history of infectious diseases. However, the theoretical underpinnings of the most widely used, coalescent methods have been questioned, casting doubt on their interpretation. The aim of this study is to develop robust population genetic inference for compartmental models in epidemiology. Using a general approach based on the theory of metapopulations, we derive coalescent models under susceptible–infectious (SI), susceptible–infectious–susceptible (SIS) and susceptible–infectious–recovered (SIR) dynamics. We show that exponential and logistic growth models are equivalent to SI and SIS models, respectively, when co-infection is negligible. Implementing SI, SIS and SIR models in BEAST, we conduct a meta-analysis of hepatitis C epidemics, and show that we can directly estimate the basic reproductive number (R(0)) and prevalence under SIR dynamics. We find that differences in genetic diversity between epidemics can be explained by differences in underlying epidemiology (age of the epidemic and local population density) and viral subtype. Model comparison reveals SIR dynamics in three globally restricted epidemics, but most are better fit by the simpler SI dynamics. In summary, metapopulation models provide a general and practical framework for integrating epidemiology and population genetics for the purposes of joint inference.",2013-03-19,"Dearlove, Bethany; Wilson, Daniel J.",Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci

Medline; PMC,Does pandemic justify the use of Hydroxychloroquine for treatment and prevention of COVID‐19 in India?,"The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), recommended the use of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) as a prophylactic against COVID‐19 among health care workers and asymptomatic contacts of laboratory confirmed cases of COVID. This is widely criticised as a hastily taken step with political inclination and minimal evidence backing. In the current scenario, where there is mass fear against COVID‐19, this recommendation has made the people to believe that it will kill the viruses. This has important public health implications which are discussed below. Better communication should have been planned to ensure everyone does not go out and buy it. However, as a nation of 1.3 billion, we need to capitalize on this opportunity to generate data and valuable evidence on the use of HCQ to beat this pandemic. All health care workers taking this drug should volunteer themselves to be part of a trial/observational study and get registered online to generate useful data related to its safety and efficacy and guide future recommendations. The other risk group which includes asymptomatic contacts of laboratory confirmed COVID‐19 patients are under surveillance by the state and local health authorities and could also be roped into this study to generate robust evidence. Of course, pandemic does not just justify the use of HCQ, but pandemic is the time to innovate, think out of box and generate evidence to prove the same so that we can lives.

Elsevier; Medline; PMC,BRD4 Prevents R-Loop Formation and Transcription-Replication Conflicts by Ensuring Efficient Transcription Elongation,"Effective spatio-temporal control of transcription and replication during S-phase is paramount to maintaining genomic integrity and cell survival. Dysregulation of these systems can lead to conflicts between the transcription and replication machinery, causing DNA damage and cell death. BRD4 allows efficient transcriptional elongation by stimulating phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). We report that bromodomain and extra-terminal domain (BET) protein loss of function (LOF) causes RNAPII pausing on the chromatin and DNA damage affecting cells in S-phase. This persistent RNAPII-dependent pausing leads to an accumulation of RNA:DNA hybrids (R-loops) at sites of BRD4 occupancy, leading to transcription-replication conflicts (TRCs), DNA damage, and cell death. Finally, our data show that the BRD4 C-terminal domain, which interacts with P-TEFb, is required to prevent R-loop formation and DNA damage caused by BET protein LOF.",2020-09-22,"Edwards, Drake S.; Maganti, Rohin; Tanksley, Jarred P.; Luo, Jie; Park, James J.H.; Balkanska-Sinclair, Elena; Ling, Jinjie; Floyd, Scott R.",Cell Rep

WHO,The impact of COVID-19 on the labour market for persons affected by Hansen's disease,"The COVID-19 pandemic impacted the whole world, affecting the econ-omy of many societies, increasing poverty and inequalities. The lockdown measures heavily affected vulnerable social groups, including persons affected by Hansen’s disease (PaHd) and their families. Stigma, late diagnosis and related disability make PaHd a population in a situation of vulnerability. Poor sanitary and socio-economic conditions, lower levels of education and food insecurity are risk markers for Hansen’s disease. Before COVID-19, PaHd were refused employment or lost their jobs due to physical impairment or discrimination. Job losses worldwide are hitting hardest on poor and vulnerable populations, therefore pushing millions of people to extreme poverty. Hansen’s disease, also known as leprosy, is only endemic in the poorest areas of the world. Although specific data regarding PaHd are scarce, we traced a parallel between the impact of the current pandemic on the labour market on various excluded and marginalized populations, such as persons with disabilities and PaHd. Our objective was to understand the current scenario and also to gather strategies and good practices to guarantee and promote the right to work as an instrument of inclusion and social advancement, to break the cycle of poverty for PaHd. © The author(s).",2021,"Corrêa de Sousa, Ana Carolina",Leprosy Review
Medline; PMC; WHO,Telework in a pandemic context: protocol of a participatory study on the effects of teleworking conditions on the well-being and social participation of workers,"INTRODUCTION: Although several authors have been interested in the well-being and social participation of teleworkers in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, it appears that most of the recommendations issued are based on literature reviews or expert opinions; yet few authors have documented the perspectives of the workers. The aim of this study is to explore workers’ perspectives of teleworking in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic regarding the effects on their well-being and social participation. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Using a participatory study protocol involving the collaboration of a community organisation defending workers’ rights, the first step will be to conduct focus groups to qualitatively describe workers’ perspectives of their teleworking conditions. Then, an online questionnaire will be administered to a large pool or workers to quantitatively explore the influence of individual, organisational and environmental variables on the well-being and social participation of workers. The thematic and statistical analyses of the data collected will indicate successful practices to be adopted by workers and organisations. These successful practices will be validated by workers through a Technique for Research of Information by Animation of a Group of Experts group and will serve as concrete tools to better support workers’ participation in teleworking. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The approval of the research ethics board of the Centre intégré universitaire de santé et de services sociaux de la Capitale Nationale has been obtained. Findings will be shared with various stakeholders including workers, employers, insurers and unions.

WHO,COVID-19 Disruption Strategy for Redesigning Global Supply Chain Network across TPP Countries,"Background: COVID-19 has disrupted and adversely affected supply chains worldwide. A global supply chain network that considers disruptions is needed. This study strategically analyzes the economic and structural effects of disruption on a global supply chain network with customs duty and the trans-pacific partnership (TPP) agreement. Methods: We present a cost minimization model which helps in understanding the difficulty of supplying materials or products to factories or customers if the supplier’s cities are facing disruption. This enables us to model and evaluate simultaneous considerations of supplier disruption, customs duty, and TPP in redesigning a global supply chain network. This network is modeled and formulated using integer programming, disruption scenarios, and a sensitivity analysis for customs duty. Results: Regarding the impact of disruptions on suppliers, two patterns emerge in the reconfigured network: direct changes due to supplier disruptions and indirect changes due to factory relocation. The sensitivity analysis for customs duty shows that the TPP has a positive impact on cost maintained, even in the presence of disruptions. Conclusions: Suppliers should be switched depending on the scale of disruption;when many distant suppliers need to be switched, the factory should be relocated to the country where these suppliers are located.",2022,"Nagao, Takaki Ijuin Hiromasa Yamada Tetsuo Nagasawa Keisuke Zhou Lei",Logistics
BioRxiv,Distinct cellular immune signatures in acute Zika virus infection are associated with high or low persisting neutralizing antibody titers,"Although the formation of a durable neutralizing antibody response after an acute viral infection is a key component of protective immunity, little is known about why some individuals generate high versus low neutralizing antibody titers to infection or vaccination. Infection with Zika virus (ZIKV) during pregnancy can cause devastating fetal outcomes, and efforts to understand natural immunity to this infection are essential for optimizing vaccine design. In this study, we leveraged the high-dimensional single-cell profiling capacity of mass cytometry (CyTOF) to deeply characterize the cellular immune response to acute and convalescent ZIKV infection in a cohort of blood donors in Puerto Rico incidentally found to be viremic during the 2015-2016 epidemic in the Americas. During acute ZIKV infection, we identified widely coordinated responses across innate and adaptive immune cell lineages. High frequencies of multiple activated innate immune subsets, as well as activated follicular helper CD4+ T cells and proliferating CD27-IgD-B cells, during acute infection were associated with high titers of ZIKV neutralizing antibodies at 6 months post-infection. On the other hand, low titers of ZIKV neutralizing antibodies were associated with immune features that suggested a cytotoxic-skewed immune “set-point.” Our study offers insight into the cellular coordination of immune responses and identifies candidate cellular biomarkers that may offer predictive value in vaccine efficacy trials for ZIKV and other acute viral infections aimed at inducing high titers of neutralizing antibodies.

Medline,"Avoiding high ozone pollution in Delhi, India.","Surface ozone is a major pollutant threatening public health, agricultural production and natural ecosystems. While measures to improve air quality in megacities such as Delhi are typically aimed at reducing levels of particulate matter (PM), ozone could become a greater threat if these measures focus on PM alone, as some air pollution mitigation steps can actually lead to an increase in surface ozone. A better understanding of the factors controlling ozone production in Delhi and the impact that PM mitigation measures have on ozone is therefore critical for improving air quality. Here, we combine in situ observations and model analysis to investigate the impact of PM reduction on the non-linear relationship between volatile organic compounds (VOC), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and ozone. In situ measurements of NOx, VOC, and ozone were conducted in Delhi during the APHH-India programme in summer (June) and winter (November) 2018. We observed hourly averaged ozone concentrations in the city of up to 100 ppbv in both seasons. We performed sensitivity simulations with a chemical box model to explore the impacts of PM on the non-linear VOC-NOx-ozone relationship in each season through its effect on aerosol optical depth (AOD). We find that ozone production is limited by VOC in both seasons, and is particularly sensitive to solar radiation in winter. Reducing NOx alone increases ozone, such that a 50% reduction in NOx emissions leads to 10-50% increase in surface ozone. In contrast, reducing VOC emissions can reduce ozone efficiently, such that a 50% reduction in VOC emissions leads to ∼60% reduction in ozone. Reducing PM alone also increases ozone, especially in winter, by reducing its dimming effects on photolysis, such that a 50% reduction in AOD can increase ozone by 25% and it also enhances VOC-limitation. Our results highlight the importance of reducing VOC emissions alongside PM to limit ozone pollution, as well as benefitting control of PM pollution through reducing secondary organic aerosol. This will greatly benefit the health of citizens and the local ecosystem in Delhi, and could have broader application for other megacities characterized by severe PM pollution and VOC-limited ozone production.",2020-11-27,"Chen, Ying; Beig, Gufran; Archer-Nicholls, Scott; Drysdale, Will; Acton, W Joe F; Lowe, Douglas; Nelson, Beth; Lee, James; Ran, Liang; Wang, Yu; Wu, Zhijun; Sahu, Saroj Kumar; Sokhi, Ranjeet S; Singh, Vikas; Gadi, Ranu; Nicholas Hewitt, C; Nemitz, Eiko; Archibald, Alex; McFiggans, Gordon; Wild, Oliver",Faraday discussions

BACKGROUND: Since an outbreak of COVID‐19 was first reported in China in December 2019, it has profoundly changed the lives of families and children of all ages. In particular, it has created challenges among families with college‐age young adult children. METHOD: Using a sample of 484 college students from 21 universities in China, an online survey design was utilized to obtain information from these students on their family demographics and economic situation, parent–child interactions, and individual well‐being during COVID‐19. RESULTS: Results from structural equation modeling suggested that family income loss due to COVID‐19 was related to economic pressure. Economic pressure was associated with negative interactions between parents and young adult children, which were associated with problems in young adult children's mental health (i.e., anxiety and depressive symptoms). Further, self‐control was found to buffer the association between family income loss and economic pressure, and respect for family was found to weaken the association between economic pressure and negative parent–child interactions. CONCLUSION: Findings supported the hypotheses of the negative impacts of COVID‐19 on young adult children's mental health and the resilience factors that buffered the negative impacts.

Seventy children with MP were divided into the RMP group (H1 group, 31 cases) and the MP group (H2 group, 39 cases) according to pathological findings, and all of them underwent CT scanning. MP-RNA load and genotype distribution were analyzed in both groups, and the diagnostic efficacy of CT combined with MP-RNA load for RMP was calculated. The sensitivity of children in the H1 group to erythromycin (59.17% vs 71.56%) and clarithromycin (53.21% vs 67.03%) was lower than that in the H2 group, and the resistance rate of children in the H1 group to erythromycin (71.43% vs 67.53%) and clarithromycin (64.24% vs 50.37%) was higher than that in the H2 group (P < 0.05); the regression coefficients between lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and the MPLI value of RMP were −0.064 and −0.413, respectively, which were significantly negatively correlated (P < 0.05); the accuracy (96.5%), sensitivity (92.5%), and specificity (88%) of CT + MP-RNA in the diagnosis of RMP were significantly higher than those of CT alone (91%, 88%, and 82%) and MP-RNA alone (88%, 84.5%, and 74%), which were significantly different (P < 0.05). The results of high MP-RNA load detection can be used as an indicator to predict RMP, and the diagnostic efficacy is significantly improved after combination with high-resolution CT, with high clinical application value.",2022-05-04,"Wei, Hongping; Wang, Chunyan; Ding, Lili; Wu, Min",Contrast Media Mol Imaging

In order to reduce progression of DKD, important management goals include treatment of hypertension, glycaemia and control of cardiovascular risk factors such as lipids, diet, smoking and exercise. Use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers has an established role in prevention of progression of DKD. A number of other agents such as endothelin-1 receptor antagonists and bardoxolone have had disappointing results. Recent studies have, however, suggested that newer antidiabetic agents such as sodium-glucose transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 analogues have specific beneficial effects in patients with DKD. Indeed most recent guidance suggest that SGLT-2i drugs should be used early in DKD, irrespective of glucose control. A number of pathways are hypothesised for the development and progression of DKD, and have opened up a number of newer potential therapeutic targets.

People connect to the Internet for work, school, shopping, entertainment, and doctor visits, including psychiatrists. Concurrently, cybercrime has surged worldwide. This narrative review examines the changing use of technology, societal impacts of the pandemic, how cybercrime is evolving, individual vulnerabilities to cybercrime, and special concerns for those with mental illness. RECENT FINDINGS: Human factors are a central component of cybersecurity as individual behaviors, personality traits, online activities, and attitudes to technology impact vulnerability. Mental illness may increase vulnerability to cybercrime. The risks of cybercrime should be recognized as victims experience long-term psychological and financial consequences. Patients with mental illness may not be aware of the dangers of cybercrime, of risky online behaviors, or the measures to mitigate risk. SUMMARY: Technology provides powerful tools for psychiatry but technology must be used with the appropriate safety measures. Psychiatrists should be aware of the potential aftermath of cybercrime on mental health, and the increased patient risk since the pandemic, including from online mental health services. As a first step to increase patient awareness of cybercrime, psychiatrists should provide a recommended list of trusted sources that educate consumers on cybersecurity.",2021-03-03,"Monteith, Scott; Bauer, Michael; Alda, Martin; Geddes, John; Whybrow, Peter C; Glenn, Tasha",Curr Psychiatry Rep
Medline,The analgesic efficacy of subcostal transversus abdominis plane block with Mercedes incision.,"BACKGROUND Conventional perioperative analgesic modalities (e.g. opioids, epidural analgesia) have their own drawbacks, which limit their clinical application. This study investigated the opioid-sparing effectsof the oblique subcostal transversus abdominis plane (OSTAP) blockade with ropivacaine for the patients undergoing open liver resection with a Mercedes incision. METHODS 126 patients who were scheduled for open liver resection were enrolled in this study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive bilateral ultrasound-guided OSTAPblocks with either 0.375% ropivacaine (groupT) or 0.9% isotonic saline (group C). Both groups also received intravenous patient-controlled analgesia and intravenous 40 mg parecoxib every 12 h for a total of 3 days. Preoperative and intraoperative parameters, plus intraoperative and postoperative cumulative sufentanil consumption, were recorded. RESULTS 70 patients were enrolled in the study finally. There were no significant differences between the two groups with respect to preoperative parameters, and surgical and anesthetic characteristics. The intraoperative sufentanil use, cumulative sufentanil consumption at 5 min after extubation, 2 h, 4 h,12 h and 24 h after operation in group T was significantly less than that in group C (P = 0.001, 0.001, 0.000, 0.000, 0.001 and 0.044, respectively). Compared with group C, postoperative NRS pain scores at rest were significantly lower at 2 h and 4 h postoperatively in group T (P = 0.04and 0.02, respectively); NRS scores at the time of coughing were also significantly lower in group T than in group C at all time points except 5 min after extubation (all P < 0.001). Furthermore, compared with group C, the number of intraoperative vasodilator use, the extubation time and the incidence of nausea was reduced in group T. CONCLUSION Ultrasound-guided OSTAP block with ropivacaine can significantly decrease the perioperative cumulative dosage of analgesics and improve analgesic effect without obvious side effects for the patients who underwent an open liver resection with Mercedes incision when compared tothe ultrasound-guided OSTAP block with saline.

WHO,Indiana CTSI High-School STEM Summer Research Program: Future opportunities from a 2020 virtual program,"IMPACT: o The Indiana Clinical and Translational Sciences Institute K-12 STEM Outreach Program’s pivoted to a virtual program in summer 2020 which yielded novel approaches that could be retained in future years to extend the reach/impact of our pipeline program. OBJECTIVES/GOALS: o Provide students with a meaningful and safe research experience during the COVID Pandemic. o Develop new modules and approaches that could be delivered virtually. o Engage students from communities that were not possible in previous years when in person meetings were required. METHODS/STUDY POPULATION: o The program has historically supported over 100 high school students per year in a summer research internship for the last 5 years. Students are placed with academic research mentors in various Schools and Departments across the IUPUI campus, and also with industry laboratories. o COVID-related restrictions required development of 100% virtual program. Key aspects of the virtual program included: cohort-based research mentor assignments with 1-4 mentees matched per research mentor, research projects that could be conducted virtually, heavy engagement of high-school teachers to facilitate the research experience with cohorts of mentees, a more rigorous virtual seminar series that included new modules such as COVID-specific programming and thus enhancing public education about COVID. RESULTS/ANTICIPATED RESULTS: o The program served 130 students in summer 2020. o We were able to recruit new faculty and industry mentors involved in data science research. As a result, we have now increased our mentor pool to serve more students in the future. o Because student participation was virtual, we were able to accept students from further distances (up to 120 miles away) across the state. We were also able to accept local economically disadvantaged students that may have not been able to participate because of lack of reliable transportation. o A positive unanticipated outcome was that mentees relationships with the mentors was established virtually thus increasing the potential for students to remain engaged in their research. DISCUSSION/SIGNIFICANCE OF FINDINGS: o Adapting to a virtual platform provided research experience to high school students during a time when traditional approaches were not possible. Given some research experiences do not require in-person activities, this newly established model could be used moving forward to allow more statewide engagement in research experiences.",2021,"Sanders, Elmer Cruz Leigh-Ann Speidell Emily Schnabel Rose Balaji Adhitya Hogarth Elise Miller Jade Vaides Sofia Allen Matthew R.",Journal of clinical and translational science
ArXiv,Identifying pandemic-related stress factors from social-media posts -- effects on students and young-adults,"The COVID-19 pandemic has thrown natural life out of gear across the globe. Strict measures are deployed to curb the spread of the virus that is causing it, and the most effective of them have been social isolation. This has led to wide-spread gloom and depression across society but more so among the young and the elderly. There are currently more than 200 million college students in 186 countries worldwide, affected due to the pandemic. The mode of education has changed suddenly, with the rapid adaptation of e-learning, whereby teaching is undertaken remotely and on digital platforms. This study presents insights gathered from social media posts that were posted by students and young adults during the COVID times. Using statistical and NLP techniques, we analyzed the behavioral issues reported by users themselves in their posts in depression-related communities on Reddit. We present methodologies to systematically analyze content using linguistic techniques to find out the stress-inducing factors. Online education, losing jobs, isolation from friends, and abusive families emerge as key stress factors.",2020-12-01,"Thukral, Sachin; Sangwan, Suyash; Chatterjee, Arnab; Dey, Lipika",

PMC,Trans cohort metabolic reprogramming towards glutaminolysis in long-term successfully treated HIV-infection,"Despite successful combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), persistent low-grade immune activation together with inflammation and toxic antiretroviral drugs can lead to long-lasting metabolic flexibility and adaptation in people living with HIV (PLWH). Our study investigated alterations in the plasma metabolic profiles by comparing PLWH on long-term cART(>5 years) and matched HIV-negative controls (HC) in two cohorts from low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), Cameroon, and India, respectively, to understand the system-level dysregulation in HIV-infection. Using untargeted and targeted LC-MS/MS-based metabolic profiling and applying advanced system biology methods, an altered amino acid metabolism, more specifically to glutaminolysis in PLWH than HC were reported. A significantly lower level of neurosteroids was observed in both cohorts and could potentiate neurological impairments in PLWH. Further, modulation of cellular glutaminolysis promoted increased cell death and latency reversal in pre-monocytic HIV-1 latent cell model U1, which may be essential for the clearance of the inducible reservoir in HIV-integrated cells.",2022-01-11,"Mikaeloff, Flora; Svensson Akusjärvi, Sara; Ikomey, George Mondinde; Krishnan, Shuba; Sperk, Maike; Gupta, Soham; Magdaleno, Gustavo Daniel Vega; Escós, Alejandra; Lyonga, Emilia; Okomo, Marie Claire; Tagne, Claude Tayou; Babu, Hemalatha; Lorson, Christian L.; Végvári, Ákos; Banerjea, Akhil C.; Kele, Julianna; Hanna, Luke Elizabeth; Singh, Kamal; de Magalhães, João Pedro; Benfeitas, Rui; Neogi, Ujjwal",Commun Biol
Medline; PMC,The COVID‐19 Menace,"Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‐19) is caused by the new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2), which binds to ectoenzyme angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2. It is very contagious and is spreading rapidly around the world. Until now, coronaviruses have mainly been associated with the aerodigestive tract due to the presence of a monobasic cleavage site for the resident transmembrane serine protease 2. Notably, SARS‐CoV‐2 is equipped with a second, polybasic cleavage site for the ubiquitous furin protease, which may determine the widespread tissue tropism. Furthermore, the terminal sequence of the furin‐cleaved spike protein also binds to neuropilin receptors. Clinically, there is enormous variability in the severity of the disease. Severe consequences are seen in a relatively small number of patients, most show moderate symptoms, but asymptomatic cases, especially among young people, drive disease spread. Unfortunately, the number of local infections can quickly build up, causing disease outbreaks suddenly exhausting health services’ capacity. Therefore, COVID‐19 is dangerous and unpredictable and has become the most serious threat for generations. Here, the latest research on COVID‐19 is summarized, including its spread, testing methods, organ‐specific complications, the role of comorbidities, long‐term consequences, mortality, as well as a new hope for immunity, drugs, and vaccines.",2021-05-07,"Walczak, Piotr; Janowski, Miroslaw",Glob Chall

Now that mid-2020 has already passed, almost every country is adversely affected by Corona Virus Disease (COVID-19). The routine activities of people of all ages are overturned, which has led to a shift in the trends of waste created by households, streets, and most importantly, medical facilities and quarantine centers. Compulsive use of personal protection equipment such as masks, gloves, sanitizers, etcetera by the frontline workers from the medical sector, banks, daily need stores, waste collection industries, etc. and the use of masks by every common man stepping out has skewed the trend of waste generation to a different direction. Recently, the replacement of single-use plastic was accepted by the masses, and the pandemic suddenly rebounded to the previous situation, it is expected to be worse in the long run. Another secondary outcome is reduced waste collection and recycling due to lockdown, leading to a pile-up of wastes. But several nations are adopting strategies to break the transmission chain of the virus by trying to minimize human contact.

Medline,A coordinate positioning puncture method under robot-assisted CT-guidance: phantom and animal experiments.,"PURPOSE To evaluate the accuracy of the robot-assisted computed tomography (CT)-guided coordinate positioning puncture method by phantom and animal experiments. MATERIAL AND METHODS In the phantom experiment, seven robot-assisted punctures were made to evaluate the accuracy of the method. In the animal experiment, 18 punctures (nine robotic and nine manual) were made in the livers of nine rabbits. The indicators, such as needle-tract length, angle deviation, puncture accuracy, number of scans required, and radiation exposure dose were compared between manual and robotic punctures. The paired-samples t-test was used for analysis. RESULTS In the phantom experiment, the mean accuracy of seven punctures was 2.67 mm. In the animal experiment, there was no significant difference in needle-tract length (32.58 mm vs. 34.04 mm, p = .606), angle deviation (17.21° vs. 21.23° p = .557) and puncture accuracy (8.42 vs. 8.77 mm, p = .851) between the two groups. However, the number CT scans required (2.44 vs. 3.33, p = .002), and the radiation exposure dose (772.98 vs. 1077.89 mGy/cm, p = .003) were lower in the robot group than in the manual group. CONCLUSIONS The coordinate positioning puncture method under robot-assisted CT-guidance can reach an accuracy that is comparable to that of the traditional manual CT-guided puncture method and with fewer CT scanning times accompanied with a lower radiation dosage.",2020-07-07,"Zhang, Weifan; Xia, Peng; Liu, Shijie; Huang, Xiaowei; Zhao, Xinhui; Liu, Zhao; Dang, Hui; Li, Xiaohu; Niu, Gang",Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy

In this review, according to the published literature, we provided the evidence that asymptomatic infections can result in person-to-person transmission. Four studies suggested that the virus can be transmitted by asymptomatic patients for at least two consecutive generations, indicating its strong infectivity. Asymptomatic infection tends to be, but is not only, identified among young people (<20 years old). The majority of asymptomatic patients appear to have a milder clinical course during hospitalization, but the severity of the symptoms of the secondary patients infected by SARS-COV-2 from asymptomatic patients varies with their physical constitution. The proportion of asymptomatic individuals among all confirmed cases widely differed (from 1.95% to 87.9%) according to the study setting and the populations studied. The increasing large-scale tests are expected to give more information about the true number of asymptomatic infections in the population. In China and other countries, various guidelines for management of asymptomatic cases have been issued. Importantly, early detection, early reporting, early isolation and early treatment of asymptomatic patients require the joint efforts of policy makers, clinicians, technicians, epidemiologists, virologists and patients.",2020-08-27,"Han, Dongsheng; Li, Rui; Han, Yanxi; Zhang, Rui; Li, Jinming",Int J Biol Sci
Medline; PMC,Evaluation of the association of length of stay in hospital and outcomes,"BACKGROUND: There exist wide variations in healthcare quality within the National Health Service (NHS). A shorter hospital length of stay (LOS) has been implicated as premature discharge, that may in turn lead to adverse consequences. We tested the hypothesis that a short LOS might be associated with increased risk of readmissions within 28 days of hospital discharge and also post-discharge mortality. METHODS: We conducted a single-centred study of 32 270 (46.1% men) consecutive alive-discharge episodes (mean age = 64.0 years, standard deviation = 20.5, range = 18–107 years), collected between 01/04/2017 and 31/03/2019. Associations of LOS tertiles (middle tertile as a reference) with readmissions and mortality were assessed using observed/expected ratios, and logistic and Cox regressions to estimate odds (OR) and hazard ratios (HR) (adjusted for age, sex, patients’ severity of underlying health status and index admissions), with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The observed numbers of readmissions within 28 days of hospital discharge or post-discharge mortality were lower than expected (observed: expected ratio < 1) in patients in the bottom tertile (<1.2 days) and middle tertile (1.2–4.3 days) of LOS, whilst higher than expected (observed: expected ratio > 1) in patients in the top tertile (>4.3 days), amongst all ages. Patients in the top tertile of LOS had increased risks for one readmission: OR = 2.32 (95% CI = 1.86–2.88) or ≥2 readmissions: OR = 6.17 (95% CI = 5.11–7.45), death within 30 days: OR = 2.87 (95% CI = 2.34–3.51), and within six months of discharge: OR = 2.52 (95% CI = 2.23–2.85), and death over a two-year period: HR = 2.25 (95% CI = 2.05–2.47). The LOS explained 7.4% and 15.9% of the total variance (r(2)) in one readmission and ≥2 readmissions, and 9.1% and 10.0% of the total variance in mortality with 30 days and within six months of hospital discharge, respectively. Within the bottom, middle and top tertiles of the initial LOS, the median duration from hospital discharge to death progressively shortened from 136, 126 to 80 days, whilst LOS during readmission lengthened from 0.4, 0.9 to 2.8 days, respectively. CONCLUSION: Short LOS in hospital was associated with favourable post-discharge outcomes such as early readmission and mortality, and with a delay in time interval from discharge to death and shorter LOS in hospital during readmission. These findings indicate that timely discharge from our hospital meets the aims of the NHS-generated national improvement programme, Getting It Right First Time.",2021-12-17,"Han, Thang S; Murray, Paul; Robin, Jonathan; Wilkinson, Peter; Fluck, David; Fry, Christopher H",Int J Qual Health Care
WHO,Impaired Endothelial Function in Convalescent Phase of COVID-19: A 3 Month Follow Up Observational Prospective Study,"Background: Endothelial dysfunction has a role in acute COVID-19, contributing to systemic inflammatory syndrome, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and vascular events. Evidence regarding COVID-19 middle- and long-term consequences on endothelium are still lacking. Our study aimed to evaluate if COVID-19 severity could significantly affect the endothelial function after three months from the acute phase. Methods: We assessed endothelial function in outpatients with previous COVID-19 three months after negative SARS-CoV-2 molecular test by measuring flow-mediated dilation (FMD) in patients categorized according to a four-variable COVID-19 severity scale ('home care';;'hospital, no oxygen';;'hospital, oxygen';;'hospital requiring high-flow nasal canula, non-invasive ventilation, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation';). FMD difference among COVID-19 severity categories was assessed with analysis of variance;we further clarified the relationship between FMD and previous COVID-19 severity with multivariate logistic models. Results: Among 658 consecutive COVID-19 subjects, we observed a significant linear trend of FMD reduction with the increase of the COVID-19 category (p < 0.0001). The presence of endothelial dysfunction was more frequent among hospitalized patients (78.3%) with respect to home-care patients (21.7%;p < 0.0001). COVID-19 severity was associated with increased endothelial dysfunction risk (OR: 1.354;95% CI: 1.06–1.71;p = 0.011) at multivariate binary logistic analysis. FMD showed a significant direct correlation with PaO2 (p = 0.004), P/F ratio (p = 0.004), FEV1 (p = 0.008), and 6MWT (p = 0.0001). Conclusions: Hospitalized COVID-19 subjects showed an impaired endothelial function three months after the acute phase that correlated with pulmonary function impairment.

BioRxiv; WHO,"Molecular dynamics simulations of the Spike trimeric ectodomain of the SARS-CoV-2 Omicron variant: structural relationships with infectivity, evasion to immune system and transmissibility","The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) Omicron variant is replacing Delta, the most prevalent variant worldwide from the beginning of 2021 until early 2022. The Omicron variant is highly transmissible and responsible for a new worldwide COVID-19 wave. Herein, we calculated molecular dynamics simulations of the SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein of Wuhan-Hu-1 strain (wild type, WT) and the Omicron variant of concern. Structural analyses reveal that the SpikeOmicron presents more conformational flexibility than SpikeWT, mainly in the N-terminal domain (NTD) and receptor-binding domain (RBD). Such flexibility results in a broader spectrum of different conformations for SpikeOmicron, whereby the RBD can more easily visit an up-conformational state. We reported how the mutations in this variant may influence the intra- and inter-protomer contacts caused by conformational flexibility. Based on our analysis, we suggest that the differences in conformational flexibility between SpikeOmicron and SpikeWT may explain the observed gains in infectivity, immune system evasion and transmissibility in this novel variant.

Medline; WHO,Contemporary management and time to revascularization in upper extremity arterial injury,"INTRODUCTION: Upper extremity arterial injury is associated with significant morbidity and mortality for trauma patients, but there is a paucity of data to guide the clinician in the management of these injuries. The goals of this review were to characterize the demographics, presentation, clinical management, and outcomes, and to evaluate how time to intervention associates with outcomes in trauma patients with upper extremity vascular injuries. METHODS: The National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) Research Data Set for the years 2007-2016 was queried in order to identify adult patients (age ≥ 18) with an upper extremity arterial injury. Patients with brachiocephalic, subclavian, axillary, or brachial artery injury using the 1998 and 2005 versions of the Abbreviated Injury Scale were included. Patients with non-survivable injuries to the brain, traumatic amputation, or other major arterial injuries to the torso or lower extremities were excluded. RESULTS: The data from 7908 patients with upper extremity arterial injuries was reviewed. Of those, 5407 (68.4%) underwent repair of the injured artery. The median Injury Severity Score (ISS) was 10 (IQR = 7-18), and 7.7% of patients had a severe ISS (≥ 25). Median time to repair was 120 min (IQR = 60-240 min). Management was open repair in 52.3%, endovascular repair in 7.3%, and combined open and endovascular repairs in 8.8%; amputation occurred in 1.8% and non-operative management was used in 31.6% of patients. Blunt mechanism of injury, crush injury, concomitant fractures/dislocations, and nerve injuries were associated with amputation, whereas simultaneous venous injury was not. There was a significant decrease in the rate of amputation when patients undergoing surgical revascularization did so within 90 min of injury (P = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Injuries to arteries of the upper extremity are managed with open repair, endovascular repair, and, rarely, amputation. Expeditious transport to the operating room for revascularization is the key for limb salvage.",2022,"Chipman, Amanda M; Ottochian, Marcus; Ricaurte, Daniel; Gunter, Grahya; DuBose, Joseph J; Stonko, David P; Feliciano, David V; Scalea, Thomas M; Morrison, Jonathan",Vascular

WHO,Identification of chemosensory genes from the antennal transcriptome of Semiothisa cinerearia,"Olfaction plays vital roles in the survival and reproduction of insects. The completion of olfactory recognition requires the participation of various complex protein families. However, little is known about the olfactory-related proteins in Semiothisa cinerearia Bremer et Grey, an important pest of Chinese scholar tree. In this study, we sequenced the antennal transcriptome of S. cinerearia and identified 125 olfactory-related genes, including 25 odorant-binding proteins (OBPs), 15 chemosensory proteins (CSPs), two sensory neuron membrane proteins (SNMPs), 52 odorant receptors (ORs), eight gustatory receptors (GRs) and 23 ionotropic receptors (IRs). BLASTX best hit results and phylogenetic analyses indicated that these genes were most identical to their respective orthologs from Ectropis obliqua. Further quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis revealed that three ScinOBPs and three ScinORs were highly expressed in male antennae, while seven ScinOBPs and twelve ScinORs were female-specifically expressed.

WHO,Clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 and multiple sclerosis,"Background: Risk factors associated with the severity of COVID- 19 in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) begin to be identified from several cohort studies Disease modifying therapies (DMTs) may modify the risk of developing a severe COVID-19 infection, beside identified risk factors such as age and comorbidities Objectives: The objective was to describe the clinical characteristics and outcomes in patients with COVID-19 and to identify the factors associated with COVID-19 severity Methods: This multicenter, retrospective, observational cohort study (COVISEP registry, NCT04355611) included patients with MS presenting with a confirmed or highly suspected diagnosis of COVID-19 between March 1, 2020 and July 14, 2020 The main outcome was COVID-19 severity assessed on a 7-point ordinal scale (ranging from 1: not hospitalized, no limitations on activities, to 7: death;cutoff at 3: hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen) We collected demographics, neurological history, Expanded Disability Severity Score (EDSS), comorbidities, COVID-19 characteristics and outcome Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to estimate the influence of collected variables on COVID-19 outcome Results: A total of 405 patients (mean age: 44 7 years, female/male: 293/112, mean disease duration: 13 4 years) were analyzed Seventy-eight patients (19 3%) had a COVID-19 severity score ≥ 3, and 12 patients (3 0%) died from COVID-19 Median EDSS was 2 0 (range: 0-9 5), 326 patients (80 5%) were on DMT There was a higher proportion of patients with COVID-19 severity score ≥ 3 among patients with no DMT relative to patients on DMTs (39 2% versus 14 4%, p&lt;0 001) Multivariate logistic regression models determined that age (OR for 10 years: 1 8, 95% CI: 1 4-2 4), EDSS (OR for EDSS ≥ 6: 4 5, 95% CI: 2 0-10 0) were independent risk factors for COVID-19 severity score ≥ 3 (hospitalization or higher severity) while immunomodulatory treatment (interferon or glatiramer acetate) was associated with lower risk of COVID-19 severity score ≥ 3 (OR: 0 2, 95% CI: 0 05-0 8) EDSS was associated with the highest variability of COVID-19 severe outcome (R2= 0 18), followed by age (R2= 0 06) and immunomodulatory treatment (R2= 0 02) Conclusions: EDSS and age were independent risk factors of severe COVID-19, while exposure to immunomodulatory DMTs (interferon and glatiramer acetate) were independently associated with lower COVID-19 severity We did not find an association between other DMTs exposure (including immunosuppressive therapies) and COVID-19 severity The identification of these risk factors should provide the rationale for an individual strategy regarding clinical management of MS patients during the COVID- 19 pandemic",2020,"Louapre, C.; Collongues, N.; Stankoff, B.; Giannesini, C.; Papeix, C.; Bensa, C.; Deschamps, R.; Creange, A.; Wahab, A.; Pelletier, J.; Heinzlef, O.; Labauge, P.; Guilloton, L.; Ahle, G.; Goudot, M.; Bigaut, K.; Laplaud, D.; Vukusic, S.; Lubetzki, C.; De Seze, J.",Multiple Sclerosis Journal
PMC,Applications of a picture fuzzy correlation coefficient in pattern analysis and decision-making,"Picture fuzzy set is an efficient tool for dealing with uncertainty and vagueness, particularly in situations that require assimilation of more dimensions of linguistic assessment such as human voting, feature selection, etc. The correlation coefficient of picture fuzzy sets is a tool to determine the association of two picture fuzzy sets. It has several applications in various disciplines like science, engineering, and management. The prominent applications include decision-making, pattern recognition, clustering analysis, medical diagnosis, etc. In this paper, we introduce a new correlation coefficient for picture fuzzy sets with the justification of its advantages. This correlation coefficient is better than the existing correlation coefficients and other such measures in the picture fuzzy theory because it considers the picture fuzzy set as a whole and also expresses the nature (positive or negative) as well as the extent of association between two PFSs. By performing some comparative analysis based on the computation of correlation degree and linguistic hedges, we establish the effectiveness of the suggested correlation measure over some available correlation measures in a picture fuzzy environment. Further, in the context of pattern recognition, we examine the performance of the proposed correlation measure over some existing picture fuzzy correlation measures. Finally, we apply the suggested picture fuzzy correlation coefficient to a decision-making problem involving the selection of an appropriate COVID-19 mask.",2021-07-12,"Singh, Surender; Ganie, Abdul Haseeb",Granul

WHO,Impact of key meteorological parameters on the spread of COVID-19 in Mumbai: Correlation and Regression Analysis,"PurposeTo understand key meteorological parameters that influence the spread of COVID-19 in Mumbai, India (based on data from April 2020 - April 2021). MethodsThe meteorological parameters chosen were Temperature, Dew Temperature, Humidity, Pressure, Wind Speed. The underlying basic relationships between meteorological parameters and COVID-19 information for Mumbai was understood using Spearmans rank correlation coefficients. After establishing basic relationships, Linear analysis and Generalized Additive Models (GAM) were used to figure out statistically significant weather parameters and model them to explain the best possible variance in the pandemic data. ResultsA model of temperature and windspeed could explain 17.3% and 8.3% of variance in Daily new cases and Daily recoveries respectively. As for deaths occurring due to the virus, a model comprising of only pressure best explains a variance of 17.3% in the data. Non-Linear modelling based on GAM confirms the findings of linear analysis and establishes certain non-linear relationships as well. ConclusionSARS-CoV-2 belongs to the class of Human Coronaviruses (HCoV) which show seasonality depending on weather conditions. The above article focuses on understanding the underlying relationships between SARS-CoV-2 and meteorological parameters that would help progress basic research and formulation of policies around the disease for each weather/season.

We hereby present the Viral Conceptual Model (VCM), centered on the virus sequence and described from four perspectives: biological (virus type and hosts/sample), analytical (annotations and variants), organizational (sequencing project) and technical (experimental technology). VCM is inspired by GCM, our previously developed Genomic Conceptual Model, but it introduces many novel concepts, as viral sequences significantly differ from human genomes. When applied to SARS-CoV2 virus, complex conceptual queries upon VCM are able to replicate the search results of recent articles, hence demonstrating huge potential in supporting virology research. In addition to VCM, we also illustrate the data dictionary for patient’s phenotype used by the COVID-19 Host Genetic Initiative. Our effort is part of a broad vision: availability of conceptual models for both human genomics and viruses will provide important opportunities for research, especially if interconnected by the same human being, playing the role of virus host as well as provider of genomic and phenotype information.",2020-05-01,"Bernasconi, Anna; Cankoglu, Arif; Pinoli, Pietro; Ceri, Stefano",bioRxiv

WHO,Modeling the Impact of Social Distancing and Targeted Vaccination on the Spread of COVID-19 through a Real City-Scale Contact Network,"We use mobile device data to construct empirical interpersonal physical contact networks in the city of Portland, Oregon, both before and after social distancing measures were enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic. These networks reveal how social distancing measures and the public's reaction to the incipient pandemic affected the connectivity patterns within the city. We find that as the pandemic developed there was a substantial decrease in the number of individuals with many contacts. We further study the impact of these different network topologies on the spread of COVID-19 by simulating an SEIR epidemic model over these networks, and find that the reduced connectivity greatly suppressed the epidemic. We then investigate how the epidemic responds when part of the population is vaccinated, and we compare two vaccination distribution strategies, both with and without social distancing. Our main result is that the heavy-tailed degree distribution of the contact networks causes a targeted vaccination strategy that prioritizes high-contact individuals to reduce the number of cases far more effectively than a strategy that vaccinates individuals at random. Combining both targeted vaccination and social distancing leads to the greatest reduction in cases, and we also find that the marginal benefit of a targeted strategy as compared to a random strategy exceeds the marginal benefit of social distancing for reducing the number of cases. These results have important implications for ongoing vaccine distribution efforts worldwide.",2021,"Hartnett, Gavin Parker Edward Gulden Timothy Vardavas Raffaele Kravitz David",

Medline; PMC; WHO,Resilience and Higher Education Support as Protective Factors for Student Academic Stress and Depression During Covid-19 in the Netherlands,"Background: The corona pandemic has forced higher education (HE) institutes to transition to online learning, with subsequent implications for student wellbeing. Aims: This study explored influences on student wellbeing throughout the first wave of the corona crisis in the Netherlands by testing serial mediation models of the relationships between perceived academic stress, depression, resilience, and HE support. Methods: The Covid-19 International Student Wellbeing Study (C19 ISWS) was used, with a total sample of 2,480 higher education students studying at InHolland Universities of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands. Student subgroups were created, so that students with low and high perceived academic stress could be assessed, in addition to depressed and non-depressed students. Predictive model fit was tested using Macro PROCESS. Results: A significant serial mediation model for the total student sample was revealed, including protective mediating effects of resilience and HE support on the positive direct effect of perceived academic stress on depression. At subgroup level, significant (partial) predictive effects of resilience on depression scores were noted. A partial serial effect between resilience and HE support was found for students with low perceived stress levels, whereas a parallel partial mediation model was present among highly academically stressed students. Regarding non-depressed students, a full parallel mediation model was found, whereas the model for depressed students inadequately explained the data. Conclusions: Overall, resilience and HE support mediate the predictive effect of academic stress on depressive symptoms among students. In addition, substantial differences in model fit arise when inspecting the students on a subgroup level. These findings contribute to the gap in knowledge regarding student wellbeing during the Covid-19 pandemic in the Netherlands, in addition to providing novel insights on student subgroup dynamics. While Covid-19 restrictions continue to demand online learning, student wellbeing may be enhanced overall by targeting resilience and increasing awareness and availability of HE support services. The current study also highlights the need for differential approaches when examining wellbeing for specific student groups.",2021-10-21,"Versteeg, Melissa; Kappe, Rutger",Front Public Health
PMC,PARPs and ADP-ribosylation in RNA biology: from RNA expression and processing to protein translation and proteostasis,"ADP-ribosylation (ADPRylation) is a posttranslational modification of proteins discovered nearly six decades ago, but many important questions remain regarding its molecular functions and biological roles, as well as the activity of the ADP-ribose (ADPR) transferase enzymes (PARP family members) that catalyze it. Growing evidence indicates that PARP-mediated ADPRylation events are key regulators of the protein biosynthetic pathway, leading from rDNA transcription and ribosome biogenesis to mRNA synthesis, processing, and translation. In this review we describe the role of PARP proteins and ADPRylation in all facets of this pathway. PARP-1 and its enzymatic activity are key regulators of rDNA transcription, which is a critical step in ribosome biogenesis. An emerging role of PARPs in alternative splicing of mRNAs, as well as direct ADPRylation of mRNAs, highlight the role of PARP members in RNA processing. Furthermore, PARP activity, stimulated by cellular stresses, such as viral infections and ER stress, leads to the regulation of mRNA stability and protein synthesis through posttranscriptional mechanisms. Dysregulation of PARP activity in these processes can promote disease states. Collectively, these results highlight the importance of PARP family members and ADPRylation in gene regulation, mRNA processing, and protein abundance. Future studies in these areas will yield new insights into the fundamental mechanisms and a broader utility for PARP-targeted therapeutic agents.",2020-03-01,"Kim, Dae-Seok; Challa, Sridevi; Jones, Aarin; Kraus, W.

Medline; WHO,Suicide attempts as a cause of pelvic injuries during the COVID-19 pandemic,"OBJECTIVES: We decided to compare the incidence and spectrum of pelvic fractures in 2020 affected by the anti-pandemic measures due to COVID-19 with previous years 2018 and 2019. METHODS: This retrospective study included 391 patients treated at the author's clinic for pelvic fractures. From the medical records we recorded gender, age, mechanism of injury, trauma energy, fracture type based on the AO classification and severity of injury. RESULTS: As expected, we observed no difference in the number of fractures caused by simple falls. However, we failed to prove a reduction in the number of high-energy injuries. In contrary, we observed an increase in the number of high-energy injuries in the period between lockdowns (p=0.0375). A surprising result was a dramatic increase in suicide attempts as a cause of pelvic fractures, with 6 (2.2 %) in 2018 and 2019 compared to 13 (10 %) in 2020 alone (p=0.0017). CONCLUSION: We observed the increased number of suicidal attempts only on a limited number of specific patients with pelvic fractures; therefore, we cannot formulate any general conclusions regarding the incidence of suicide during the COVID-19 pandemic.

WHO,Remote eye-tracking for cognitive telerehabilitation and interactive school tasks in times of COVID-19,"In the attempt to mitigate the effects of COVID-19 lockdown, most countries have recently authorized and promoted the adoption of e-learning and remote teaching technologies, often with the support of teleconferencing platforms. Unfortunately, not all students can benefit from the adoption of such a surrogate of their usual school. We were asked to devise a way to allow a community of children affected by the Rett genetic syndrome, and thus unable to communicate verbally, in writing or by gestures, to actively participate in remote rehabilitation and special education sessions by exploiting eye-gaze tracking. As not all subjects can access commercial eye-tracking devices, we investigated new ways to facilitate the access to eye gaze-based interaction for this specific case. The adopted communication platform is a videoconferencing software, so all we had at our disposal was a live video stream of the child. As a solution to the problem, we developed a software (named SWYG) that only runs at the ""operator"" side of the communication, at the side of the videoconferencing software, and does not require to install other software in the child's computer. The preliminary results obtained are very promising and the software is ready to be deployed on a larger base.

PMC,"Laboratory-based respiratory virus surveillance pilot project on select cruise ships in Alaska, 2013–15()","BACKGROUND: Influenza outbreaks can occur among passengers and crews during the Alaska summertime cruise season. Ill travellers represent a potential source for introduction of novel or antigenically drifted influenza virus strains to the United States. From May to September 2013–2015, the Alaska Division of Public Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and two cruise lines implemented a laboratory-based public health surveillance project to detect influenza and other respiratory viruses among ill crew members and passengers on select cruise ships in Alaska. METHODS: Cruise ship medical staff collected 2–3 nasopharyngeal swab specimens per week from passengers and crew members presenting to the ship infirmary with acute respiratory illness (ARI). Specimens were tested for respiratory viruses at the Alaska State Virology Laboratory (ASVL); a subset of specimens positive for influenza virus were sent to CDC for further antigenic characterization. RESULTS: Of 410 nasopharyngeal specimens, 83% tested positive for at least one respiratory virus; 71% tested positive for influenza A or B virus. Antigenic characterization of pilot project specimens identified strains matching predominant circulating seasonal influenza virus strains, which were included in the northern or southern hemisphere influenza vaccines during those years. Results were relatively consistent across age groups, recent travel history, and influenza vaccination status. Onset dates of illness relative to date of boarding differed between northbound (occurring later in the voyage) and southbound (occurring within the first days of the voyage) cruises. CONCLUSIONS: The high yield of positive results indicated that influenza was common among passengers and crews sampled with ARI. This finding reinforces the need to bolster influenza prevention and control activities on cruise ships. Laboratory-based influenza surveillance on cruise ships may augment inland influenza surveillance and inform control activities. However, these benefits should be weighed against the costs and operational limitations of instituting laboratory-based surveillance programs on ships.",2017-10-06,"Rogers, Kimberly B.; Roohi, Shahrokh; Uyeki, Timothy M.; Montgomery, David; Parker, Jayme; Fowler, Nisha H.; Xu, Xiyan; Ingram, Deandra J.; Fearey, Donna; Williams, Steve M.; Tarling, Grant; Brown, Clive M.; Cohen, Nicole J.",Journal of Travel Medicine

WHO,Rapid SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis using disposable strips and a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor platform,"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has had a significant impact worldwide. Currently, the most common detection methods for the virus are polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and lateral flow tests. PCR takes more than an hour to obtain the results and lateral flow tests have difficulty with detecting the virus at low concentrations. In this study, 60 clinical human saliva samples, which included 30 positive and 30 negative samples confirmed with RT-PCR, were screened for COVID-19 using disposable glucose biosensor strips and a reusable printed circuit board. The disposable strips were gold plated and functionalized to immobilize antibodies on the gold film. After functionalization, the strips were connected to the gate electrode of a metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor on the printed circuit board to amplify the test signals. A synchronous double-pulsed bias voltage was applied to the drain of the transistor and strips. The resulting change in drain waveforms was converted to digital readings. The RT-PCR-confirmed saliva samples were tested again using quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) to determine cycling threshold (Ct) values. Ct values up to 45 refer to the number of amplification cycles needed to detect the presence of the virus. These PCR results were compared with digital readings from the sensor to better evaluate the sensor technology. The results indicate that the samples with a range of Ct values from 17.8 to 35 can be differentiated, which highlights the increased sensitivity of this sensor technology. This research exhibits the potential of this biosensor technology to be further developed into a cost-effective, point-of-care, and portable rapid detection method for SARS-CoV-2.",2022,"Chiu, C.

PMC,Thoracic fluid content: a novel parameter for predicting failed weaning from mechanical ventilation,"BACKGROUND: Weaning of patients from the mechanical ventilation remains one of the critical decisions in intensive care unit. This study aimed to evaluate the accuracy of thoracic fluid content (TFC) as a predictor of weaning outcome. METHODS: An observational cohort study included 64 critically ill surgical patients who were eligible for extubation. Before initiating the spontaneous breathing trial, the TFC was measured using the electrical cardiometry technology. Patients were followed up after extubation and divided into successful weaning group and failed weaning group. Both groups were compared according to respiratory and cardiovascular parameters. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the ability of TFC to predict weaning outcome. RESULTS: The number of successfully weaned patients was 41/64 (64%). Twenty (31%) patients had impaired cardiac contractility, and of them, 13/20 (64%) patients were successfully extubated. Both groups, successful weaning group and failed weaning group, were comparable in most of baseline characteristics; however, the TFC was significantly higher in the failed weaning group compared to the successful weaning group. The area under the ROC curves (AUCs) showed moderate predictive ability for the TFC in predicting weaning failure (AUC [95% confidence interval] 0.69 [0.57–0.8], cutoff value > 50 kΩ(−1)), while the predictive ability of TFC was excellent in the subgroup of patients with ejection fraction < 40% (AUC [95% confidence interval 0.93 [0.72–1], cutoff value > 50 kΩ(−1)).

WHO,Smart and Contactless Person Identification System in the COVID 19 Pandemic Process,"The Covid 19 Pandemic has had an impact on many aspects of our daily lives such as Restricting contact through touch, wearing masks, practicing social distancing, staying indoors which has led to change in our behaviors and prioritized the importance of safety hygiene. We travel to different places such as Schools, Colleges, Restaurants, offices, and Hospitals. How do we adapt to these changes and refrain from getting the virus? Luckily, we have the technology to aid us. We are all used to biometric systems for marking our Presence/ Attendance in places like colleges, Offices, and Schools with fingerprint sensors, fingerprint sensors use our Fingerprint to mark our presence however Covid 19 has restricted the use of touch causing problems in marking attendance. One way to resolve the problem is using Artificial Intelligence by using a Recognizer to identify people with their face and iris features. We implement the Face Recognition and the Iris Recognition using two models which run concurrently, one to Recognize the Face by extracting the features of the face and passing the 128-d points to the Neural Network (Mobile net and Resnet Architecture). which gives the identity of the person whose image was matched with the trained database and the other by extracting iris features to recognize people.

WHO,The impact of Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on migraine disorder,"OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the Coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic on patients with migraine. METHODS: Self-reported data from a migraine tracking smartphone application, Migraine Buddy, were used. Data were collected from users who reported at least one attack in the Jan, Feb, Mar and Apr of 2018, 2019 and 2020. In addition, a survey was conducted to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on migraine management. RESULTS: On average, data from 124,717 users per month (mean age 36.3 ± 10.9 years and 89% female) were collected. Overall, the mean frequency of migraine headache was higher in 2020 than in 2019 and higher in 2019 than in 2018. The four commonest headache triggers in 2018, 2019 and 2020 were stress in 39.7, 38.4 and 36.1%, lack of sleep in 25, 25 and 22.8%, neck pain, 20, 20.4 and 19.3 and anxiety in 19, 18.4 and 18.4% of participants, respectively. 1689 users participated in the survey and they reported that they preferred face-to-face (54.29%) to telehealth (11.9%) consultations. CONCLUSION: An increase in migraine frequency from 2018 to 2020 was reported by the users of the mobile phone. This could reflect a real increase or change in reporting habits. Stress, lack of sleep, neck pain and anxiety were the commonest attack triggers. The frequency of these triggers decreased slightly in 2020 compared to 2019 and 2018. An increase in telehealth consultations with specialists was reported in the survey but migraine patients preferred face-to-face consultations.",2021,"Haghdoost, Faraidoon; Carcel, Cheryl; Chandrasekhar, Deepak; Rodgers, Anthony; Delcourt, Candice",J. neurol
Elsevier; Medline; PMC,SARS in Singapore: surveillance strategies in a globalising city,"Public health measures employed to fight against the spread of SARS need to be guided by biomedical knowledge as well as an understanding of the social science aspects of the disease. Using Singapore as a case study, we explore how the state constructs the disease and implements measures targeted at creating a ring of defense around the island and using surveillance to monitor and prevent its spread. While there is support, there is also resentment among some Singaporeans who complain that their right to privacy has been invaded and that over surveillance may have actually occurred. Marginalisation and discrimination have not only affected the local population but in this open economy which is striving to achieve global city status, businesses, tourism, foreign talent, foreign contract workers and foreign students studying in Singapore have also been negatively affected. While Singapore has been applauded by WHO and used as an example of quick and effective response, a holistic approach to the management of infectious disease must address the social implications of strategies that are drawn from medical knowledge alone because it impinges on the social lives of people and how people interact with each other under stressful circumstances.",2004-12-07,"Teo, Peggy; Yeoh, Brenda S.A.; Ong, Shir Nee",Health Policy

From March 11th to April 14th, 814 patients were confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive in Cuba. Seven hundred sixty-one (93.4%) were treated with a combination of oral antivirals (lopinavir/ritonavir and chloroquine) with intramuscular administration of IFN-&#945;2b (Heberon® Alpha R, Center for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Havana, Cuba), 3 times per week, for 2 weeks. Fifty-three patients received the approved COVID protocol without IFN treatment. The proportion of patients discharged from hospital (without clinical and radiological symptoms and nondetectable virus by real-time polymerase chain reaction) was higher in the IFN-treated compared with the non-IFN treated group (95.4% vs. 26.1%, P < 0.01). The case fatality rate (CFR) for all patients was 2.95%, and for those patients who received IFN-&#945;2b the CFR was reduced to 0.92. Intensive care was required for 82 patients (10.1%), 42 (5.5%) had been treated with IFN.

WHO,COVID-Well Study: Qualitative Evaluation of Supported Wellbeing Centres and Psychological First Aid for Healthcare Workers during the COVID-19 Pandemic,"Supported wellbeing centres were set up in UK hospital trusts as an early intervention aimed at mitigating the psychological impact of COVID-19 on healthcare workers. These provided high quality rest spaces with peer-to-peer psychological support provided by National Health Service (NHS) staff volunteers called 'wellbeing buddies', trained in psychological first aid. The aim of the study was to explore the views of centre visitors and operational staff towards this COVID-19 workforce wellbeing provision. Qualitative semi-structured interviews were undertaken with twenty-four (20F, 4M) employees from an acute hospital trust in the UK. Interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed, data were handled and analysed using thematic analysis. Interviews generated 3 over-arching themes, and 13 sub-themes covering 'exposure and job roles', 'emotional impacts of COVID-19 and 'the wellbeing centres'. Supported wellbeing centres were viewed as critical for the wellbeing of hospital employees during the first surge of COVID-19 in the UK. Wellbeing initiatives require managerial advocacy and must be inclusive. Job-related barriers to work breaks and accessing staff wellbeing provisions should be addressed. High quality rest spaces and access to peer-to-peer support are seen to benefit individuals, teams, organisations and care quality. Training NHS staff in psychological first aid is a useful approach to supporting the wellbeing of the NHS workforce during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.",2021,"Blake, Holly; Gupta, Alisha; Javed, Mahnoor; Wood, Ben; Knowles, Steph; Coyne, Emma; Cooper, Joanne",Int. j. environ. res. public health (Online)

WHO,The Methodology and Application of a Migration with Dignity Framework,"The scale of migration is increasing, and while great uncertainty exists in identifying exact numbers, the estimated number of international migrants is already surpassing 2050 projections in the order of 2.6%, or 230 million. As people migrate, they face a number of challenges including exposure to disease and other health threats, violence and assualt, trafficking and unlawful detention. However, of the protections avail-able to migrants, the implementation and realization of these protections and how they impact the individual experiences of migrants and their loss of human rights and dignity rights across the migration cycle, are lacking. In acknowledgement of this, McClain et al. developed a legal and policy framework for Migration with Dignity, which identified six fundamental elements central to the migration experience that can supplement and support the implementation of migrant protections. The framework was built upon the foundational policy of former President of Kiribati, Anote Tong, who understood the climate change was impacting the lives and livelihoods of his people and that in the face of diminishing land area and opportunities, that the Kiribati should have the opportunity to determine when and how they migrate, and that in doing so that they are able to live a life that is equal to or better than the one they left behind. The Migration with Dignity framework offers an opportunity to provide policy and legal options to governments, policy makers, and NGO’s for how to improve to consider the dignity of migrants while they move, and improve the transition of migrants into new set-tings, while also fostering opportunities for improved livelihoods. However, in order to provide these opportunities, the framework would benefit from additional application of the fundamental elements across different contexts and in different settings. With this in mind, this article provides the necessary methodology for considering the social and legal dimensions of the framework, it also provides examples for how to apply the framework across multiple contexts. © Fuji Technology Press Ltd.",2022,"McClain, S.

However, it remains unclear the extent to which observed discriminative performance is attributable to behavioral change after receiving test results. We conducted a retrospective study in a sample of medical interns who received COVID-19 test results from March to December 2020. Our data confirmed that sensor data were able to differentiate between symptomatic COVID-19 positive and negative individuals with good accuracy (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.75). However, removing post-result data substantially reduced discriminative capacity (0.75 to 0.63; delta= −0.12, p=0.013). Removing data in the symptomatic period prior to receipt of test results did not produce similar reductions in discriminative capacity. These findings suggest a meaningful proportion of the discriminative capacity of wearable sensor data for SARS-CoV-2 infection may be due to behavior change after receiving test results.",2021-04-22,"Cleary, Jennifer L.; Fang, Yu; Sen, Srijan; Wu, Zhenke",medRxiv
Elsevier; Medline; PMC; WHO,How do policy levers shape the quality of a national health system?,"Poor quality of care may have a detrimental effect on access and take-up and can become a serious barrier to the universality of health services. This consideration is of particular interest in view of the fact that health systems in many countries must address a growing public-sector deficit and respond to increasing pressures due to COVID-19 and aging population, among other factors. In line with a rapidly emerging literature, we focus on patient satisfaction as a proxy for quality of health care. Drawing on rich longitudinal and cross-sectional data for Spain and multilevel estimation techniques, we show that in addition to individual level differences, policy levers (such as public health spending and the patient-doctor ratio, in particular) exert a considerable influence on the quality of a health care system. Our results suggest that policymakers seeking to enhance the quality of care should be cautious when compromising the level of health resources, and in particular, health personnel, as a response to economic downturns in a sector that traditionally had insufficient human resources in many countries, which have become even more evident in the light of the current health crisis. Additionally, we provide evidence that the increasing reliance on the private health sector may be indicative of inefficiencies in the public system and/or the existence of features of private insurance which are deemed important by patients.",2021-10-21,"García-Corchero, Juan David; Jiménez-Rubio, Dolores",J Policy Model

Medline; PMC; WHO,Gendering boundary work: Experiences of work–family practices among Finnish working parents during COVID‐19 lockdown,"In the spring of 2020, the COVID‐19 outbreak and governmental lockdowns changed the everyday lives of families with children worldwide. Due to remote work recommendations and the closing of school premises and childcare centers, work–family boundaries became blurred in many families. In this study, we examine the possibly gendered boundary work practices among Finnish parents during the COVID‐19 lockdown in spring 2020 by asking, how do parents perceive the blurring of work–family boundaries? What kind of boundary work practices did families develop to manage their work and family roles, and were these practices gendered and how? Boundary practices are analyzed by combining theories of doing boundaries and gender theories in the context of the COVID‐19 pandemic and applying them to survey data. The results revealed that during lockdown, both spatial and temporal boundaries blurred or partly disappeared, and boundary practices developed by families were highly gendered. Especially in families where childcare practices had been gendered already before the lockdown, it was predominantly mothers, who shouldered the main responsibility of increased childcare and struggled to manage their work duties. Hence, families had varying means to cope with blurring boundaries based on their ability to switch to remote work, but also on their work–family practices before the pandemic.",2021-11-13,"Otonkorpi‐Lehtoranta, Katri; Salin, Milla; Hakovirta, Mia; Kaittila, Anniina",Gend Work Organ
Medline; PMC,Spatiotemporal Characteristics of COVID-19 Epidemic in the United States,"BACKGROUND: A range of near-real-time online/mobile mapping dashboards and applications have been used to track the COVID-19 pandemic worldwide. It remains unknown about small area-based spatiotemporal patterns of COVID-19 in the United States. METHODS: We obtained county-based counts of COVID-19 cases confirmed in the United States from January 22 to May 13, 2020 (N=1,386,050). We characterized the dynamics of COVID-19 epidemic through detecting weekly hotspots of newly confirmed cases using Spatial and Space-Time Scan Statistics and quantifying the trends of incidence of COVID-19 by county characteristics using the Joinpoint analysis. RESULTS: Along with the national plateau reached in early April, COVID-19 incidence significantly decreased in the Northeast (estimated weekly percentage changes [EWPC]: -16.6%), but remained increasing in the Midwest, South and West Regions (EWPCs: 13.2%, 5.6%, and 5.7%, respectively). Higher risks of clustering and incidence of COVID-19 were consistently observed in metropolitan vs rural counties, counties closest to core airports, most populous counties, and counties with highest proportion of racial/ethnic minority counties. However, geographic differences in the incidence have shrunk since early April, driven by a significant decrease in the incidence in these counties (EWPC range: -2.0% – -4.2%) and a consistent increase in other areas (EWPC range: 1.5% – 20.3%). CONCLUSIONS: To substantially decrease the nationwide incidence of COVID-19, strict social distancing measures should be continuously implemented, especially in geographic areas with increasing risks, including rural areas. Spatiotemporal characteristics and trends of COVID-19 should be considered in decision-making on the timeline of re-opening for states and localities.",2020-07-08,"Wang, Yun; Liu, Ying; Struthers, James; Lian, Min",Clin Infect Dis
Medline,Effective method of gallbladder retraction for single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy.,"INTRODUCTION Recently, single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy has been accepted as an alternative to conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the safety and feasibility of unique gallbladder retraction methods using an ENDOLOOP® (Ethicon, Tokyo, Japan) and Lapaherclosure™ (Hakko Medical, Tokyo, Japan). MATERIALS AND SURGICAL TECHNIQUE From May 2013 to April 2015, 77 patients underwent single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy with this retraction technique. During the same period, conventional laparoscopic cholecystectomy was performed in 85 patients; these patients were the control group. The patients' data, including the operative time, total blood loss, conversion rate to laparotomy, and perioperative complications, were compared. Alexis® Wound Retractor XS (Applied Medical, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted through a 25-30-mm vertical transumbilical incision to prevent bile contamination. Next, a SILS Port (Covidien, Tokyo, Japan) was inserted. A flexible 5-mm laparoscope was inserted through the port with a grasper (SILS Clinch, Covidien) and a normal 5-mm scalpel. The fundus of the gallbladder was tied by the ENDOLOOP. The Lapaherclosure was then directly inserted through a right lower intercostal space to capture and pull the Lapaherclosure out. After the cystic artery and duct were cut, the resected gallbladder was directly extracted from the umbilical incision. DISCUSSION Several methods and devices have been developed to perform single-incision laparoscopic cholecystectomy, including the suturing method, the Mini Loop Retractor II (Covidien), and the EndoGrab (Virtual Ports, Caesarea, Israel). However, considering medical costs and safety, our retraction method seems to be feasible and comparable to existing methods.",2019,"Funamizu, Naotake; Okamoto, Tomoyoshi; Kumamoto, Tomotaka; Kazama, Takashi; Watanabe, Atsushi; Fujioka, Shuichi; Yanaga, Katsuhiko",Asian journal of endoscopic surgery
WHO,What Can We Learn from the Time Evolution of COVID-19 Epidemic in Slovenia?,"A recent work indicates that temporarily splitting larger populations into smaller groups can efficiently mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus. The fact that, soon afterward, the two million people Slovenia was the first European country proclaiming the end of COVID-19 epidemic within national borders may be relevant from this perspective. Motivated by this evolution, in this paper the time dynamics of coronavirus cases in Slovenia is investigated with emphasis on how efficient various containment measures act to diminish the number of COVID-19 infections. Noteworthily, the present analysis does not rely on any speculative theoretical assumption; it is solely based on raw epidemiological data. Out of the results presented here, the most important one is perhaps the finding that, while imposing drastic curfews and travel restrictions reduce the infection rate &#954; by a factor of four with respect to the unrestricted state, they only improve the &#954;-value by &#8776;15% as compared to the much bearable state of social and economic life wherein wearing face masks and social distancing rules are enforced/followed.

Medline; PMC; WHO,Reuse of face masks among adults in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic,"BACKGROUND: During the COVID-19 pandemic, over 99% of adults in Hong Kong use face masks in public. With the limited supply of face masks in the market and the uncertainty about the future development of COVID-19, reusing face masks is a legitimate way to reduce usage. Although this practice is not recommended, reusing face masks is common in Hong Kong. This study aimed to examine the practice of reusing face masks among adults in Hong Kong during the COVID-19 pandemic and its association with their health beliefs toward this health crisis. METHODS: A cross-sectional descriptive study was conducted. A quota sample of 1000 adults was recruited in Hong Kong in April 2020. Guided by the Health Belief Model, the subjects were invited to answer questions on their practice of reusing face masks and health beliefs toward COVID-19 through telephone interview. Their practice on reuse, storage, and decontamination of used face masks were summarized by descriptive statistics. The difference in health beliefs between the subjects who reused and did not reuse face masks was examined by conducting an independent t test. The association between health beliefs and reuse of face masks was determined by conducting a logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: One-third (n = 345, 35.4%) of the subjects reused face masks in an average of 2.5 days. Among them, 207 subjects stored and 115 subjects decontaminated their used face masks by using various methods. The subjects who reused face masks significantly perceived having inadequate face masks (t = 3.905; p < 0.001). Having a higher level of perception of having inadequate face masks increased the likelihood of reusing face masks (OR = 0.784; CI 95%: 0.659–0.934; p = 0.006). CONCLUSION: Despite having 90 face masks in stock, the adults who reused face masks significantly perceived that they had inadequate face masks. Concerted effort of health care professionals, community organizations, and the government will improve individuals’ practice in use of face masks and alleviate their actual and perceived feeling of having inadequate face masks, which lead them to reuse.",2021-06-29,"Lee, Linda Yin-king; Chan, Issac Chun-wing; Wong, Owen Pak-man; Ng, Yaki Hoi-ying; Ng, Crystal Kit-ying; Chan, Max Hin-wa; Ng, Joe Ka-chun; Koo, Hailey Hei-tung; Lam, Suk-ting; Chu, Ada Cho-wai; Wong, Rachel Yuen-shan; Leung, Heidi Po-ying; Pun, Angel Lok-ching",BMC Public Health

We aim to audit our practice during the initial COVID-19 pandemic. Materials & Methods: A retrospective analysis of 94 patients admitted with ureteric colic during the initial COVID-19 pandemic (March to June 2020). Data was collected from records and outcomes compared to a pre-pandemic audit of our acute stone service (January to June 2018). Results: Patient demographics were comparable: 33 admissions/month (pre-COVID 37), average age 52 years (pre-COVID 53 years), and median stone size 6 mm (pre-COVID 5mm). Septic patients (23%, pre-COVID 17%) underwent ureteric stenting (23%, pre-COVID 17%) or nephrostomy (10%, pre-COVID <1%). For non-septic patients, 46% underwent primary treatment (ureteroscopy:ESWL = 1:1, pre-COVID = 2:1), 24% ureteric stenting (pre-COVID 31%) and 30% conservative management (pre-COVID 34%). Median time to primary ureteroscopy (94% successful) and ESWL (76% successful;1-2 sessions) was 24 hours (target <48 hours). Median time from stent insertion to definite ureteroscopy was 5.8 weeks (pre-COVID 6.6 weeks, target <4 weeks) and subsequent cystoscopic stent removal was 4 weeks (target <2 weeks). For patients managed conservatively, median time to outpatient review was 7.1 weeks (pre-COVID 5.4 weeks, target <4 weeks) and follow-up imaging 8.2 weeks. Conclusions: These results from one of the largest stone units in the UK show, that despite the pandemic, primary stone intervention was still achievable within 24 hours. There was a greater reliance on ESWL and nephrostomy insertion due to concerns regarding general anaesthesia and COVID-19.",2021-06-30,"Rizvi, I.

WHO,"Sex, gender and COVID-19: a call to action","An understanding of the influence of sex (biological attributes) and gender (socially constructed roles, behaviours, expressions, identities) factors on the risk of infection, hospitalization and death is of urgent importance in the COVID-19 pandemic response effort. Despite similar global rates of infection with Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic), hospitalizations and mortality are higher in men than in women. Females may be less vulnerable to viral infection due to sex-based differences in immune responses and renin-angiotensin system activity. The response and side effects of currently studied potential therapies for COVID-19, such as hydroxychloroquine, likely differ by sex. Women form the majority of the health care workforce and a uniform approach to sizing of personal protective equipment may provide differing levels of protection from viral infection to health care workers of varying shapes and sizes. Important gender differences exist in the response to public health measures to prevent and contain spread of COVID-19, as well as presentation for testing and medical care, which may inadvertently propagate viral spread. Targeted approaches that consider both sex and gender, as well as measures of intersectionality, are urgently needed in the response efforts against COVID-19.",2020,"Ahmed, Sofia B; Dumanski, Sandra M",Can. j. public health

WHO,"A proposal to leverage high-quality veterinary diagnostic laboratory large data streams for animal health, public health, and One Health","Test data generated by ~60 accredited member laboratories of the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians (AAVLD) is of exceptional quality. These data are captured by 1 of 13 laboratory information management systems (LIMSs) developed specifically for veterinary diagnostic laboratories (VDLs). Beginning ~2000, the National Animal Health Laboratory Network (NAHLN) developed an electronic messaging system for LIMS to automatically send standardized data streams for 14 select agents to a national repository. This messaging enables the U.S. Department of Agriculture to track and respond to high-consequence animal disease outbreaks such as highly pathogenic avian influenza. Because of the lack of standardized data collection in the LIMSs used at VDLs, there is, to date, no means of summarizing VDL large data streams for multi-state and national animal health studies or for providing near-real-time tracking for hundreds of other important animal diseases in the United States that are detected routinely by VDLs. Further, VDLs are the only state and federal resources that can provide early detection and identification of endemic and emerging zoonotic diseases. Zoonotic diseases are estimated to be responsible for 2.5 billion cases of human illness and 2.7 million deaths worldwide every year.

Elsevier; Medline; PMC,A consideration of convalescent plasma and plasma derivatives in the care of Severely-ill patients with COVID-19,"The pathogenesis and immunopathological damage of severe forms of COVID-19 resemble acute autoimmune disease sparked by SARS-CoV-2, including an early systemic overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines. Such immunopathological features provide a rationale for the use of passive immunotherapy with convalescent plasma as a source of neutralizing anti-viral antibodies and of anti-inflammatory plasma components. While convalescent plasma therapy is now being evaluated in prospective clinical trials, we further consider the therapeutic potential of human hyper immune globulins, and of heterologous, engineered and monoclonal neutralizing antibodies as anti-viral agents to treat COVID-19.

Medline; PMC,Collaboration Structures in COVID-19 Critical Care: Retrospective Network Analysis Study,"BACKGROUND: Few intensive care unit (ICU) staffing studies have examined the collaboration structures of health care workers (HCWs). Knowledge about how HCWs are connected to the care of critically ill patients with COVID-19 is important for characterizing the relationships among team structures, care quality, and patient safety. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to discover differences in the teamwork structures of COVID-19 critical care by comparing HCW collaborations in the management of critically ill patients with and without COVID-19. METHODS: In this retrospective study, we used network analysis methods to analyze the electronic health records (EHRs) of 76 critically ill patients (with COVID-19: n=38; without COVID-19: n=38) who were admitted to a large academic medical center, and to learn about HCW collaboration. We used the EHRs of adult patients who were admitted to the COVID-19 ICU at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Nashville, Tennessee, United States) between March 17, 2020, and May 31, 2020. We matched each patient according to age, gender, and their length of stay. Patients without COVID-19 were admitted to the medical ICU between December 1, 2019, and February 29, 2020. We used two sociometrics—eigencentrality and betweenness—to quantify HCWs’ statuses in networks. Eigencentrality characterizes the degree to which an HCW is a core person in collaboration structures. Betweenness centrality refers to whether an HCW lies on the path of other HCWs who are not directly connected. This sociometric was used to characterize HCWs’ broad skill sets. We measured patient staffing intensity in terms of the number of HCWs who interacted with patients’ EHRs. We assessed the statistical differences in the core and betweenness statuses of HCWs and the patient staffing intensities of COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 critical care, by using Mann-Whitney U tests and reporting 95% CIs. RESULTS: HCWs in COVID-19 critical care were more likely to frequently work with each other (eigencentrality: median 0.096) than those in non–COVID-19 critical care (eigencentrality: median 0.057; P<.001). Internal medicine physicians in COVID-19 critical care had higher core statuses than those in non–COVID-19 critical care (P=.001). Nurse practitioners in COVID-19 care had higher betweenness statuses than those in non–COVID-19 care (P<.001). Compared to HCWs in non–COVID-19 settings, the EHRs of critically ill patients with COVID-19 were used by a larger number of internal medicine nurse practitioners (P<.001), cardiovascular nurses (P<.001), and surgical ICU nurses (P=.002) and a smaller number of resident physicians (P<.001). CONCLUSIONS: Network analysis methodologies and data on EHR use provide a novel method for learning about differences in collaboration structures between COVID-19 and non–COVID-19 critical care. Health care organizations can use this information to learn about the novel changes that the COVID-19 pandemic has imposed on collaboration structures in urgent care.",2021-03-08,"Yan, Chao; Zhang, Xinmeng; Gao, Cheng; Wilfong, Erin; Casey, Jonathan; France, Daniel; Gong, Yang; Patel, Mayur; Malin, Bradley; Chen, You",JMIR Hum Factors
Medline; PMC,Harnessing the immune system via FcγR function in immune therapy: a pathway to next‐gen mAbs,"The human fragment crystallizable (Fc)γ receptor (R) interacts with antigen‐complexed immunoglobulin (Ig)G ligands to both activate and modulate a powerful network of inflammatory host‐protective effector functions that are key to the normal physiology of immune resistance to pathogens. More than 100 therapeutic monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are approved or in late stage clinical trials, many of which harness the potent FcγR‐mediated effector systems to varying degrees. This is most evident for antibodies targeting cancer cells inducing antibody‐dependent killing or phagocytosis but is also true to some degree for the mAbs that neutralize or remove small macromolecules such as cytokines or other Igs. The use of mAb therapeutics has also revealed a “scaffolding” role for FcγR which, in different contexts, may either underpin the therapeutic mAb action such as immune agonism or trigger catastrophic adverse effects. The still unmet therapeutic need in many cancers, inflammatory diseases or emerging infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS‐CoV‐2) requires increased effort on the development of improved and novel mAbs. A more mature appreciation of the immunobiology of individual FcγR function and the complexity of the relationships between FcγRs and antibodies is fueling efforts to develop more potent “next‐gen” therapeutic antibodies. Such development strategies now include focused glycan or protein engineering of the Fc to increase affinity and/or tailor specificity for selective engagement of individual activating FcγRs or the inhibitory FcγRIIb or alternatively, for the ablation of FcγR interaction altogether. This review touches on recent aspects of FcγR and IgG immunobiology and its relationship with the present and future actions of therapeutic mAbs.",2020-04-12,"Chenoweth, Alicia M; Wines, Bruce D; Anania, Jessica C; Mark Hogarth, P",Immunol Cell Biol
Medline,Techniques for lung surgery: a review of robotic lobectomy.,"INTRODUCTION Robotic lobectomy is an increasingly common surgical approach for anatomic lung resection. Over the last decade, robotic lobectomy has shown to be safe, with oncologic efficacy similar to lobectomy via thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Comparative analysis between these modalities is an active area of investigation. While initially expensive, the costs of a robotic platform decrease as the number of operations performed increases, length of stay is shortened, and postoperative morbidity is reduced. Moreover, the added cost has value which is defined over long periods of time. Areas covered: The clinical technique and optimal conduct of lobectomy is explained in granular detail for all five types of lobectomies. The advantages and disadvantages of a robotic platform are analyzed, including a review of the recent literature. Expert commentary: The number of robotic pulmonary resections performed has tripled in the past two years. Anticipated developments in robotic surgery include improvements in robotic training, continued refinement of robotic instrumentation, and additional adjunctive technologies. The overall costs of robotic surgery will decrease, in part, due to increasing competition as additional companies enter the market.",2018,"Chen, Sophia; Geraci, Travis C; Cerfolio, Robert James",Expert review of respiratory medicine

Most infected people have mild or moderate symptoms and recover without the need for extensive treatment. However, for seriously ill patients, no specific treatments are currently available. Convalescent plasma therapy (CPT), a passive immunotherapy, involves infusing plasma from recovered people into actively infected people, and is thought to be a specific intervention to improve outcome in patients with severe COVID-19. The presumed mechanism involves neutralizing antibodies and antibody dependent cytotoxicity/phagocytosis. Previous CPT trials showed an effect in SARS and pilot studies suggest CPT is an effective and safe strategy for seriously ill COVID-19 patients. CPT is currently being tested in large randomized clinical trials. Herein, we critically review the mechanism, applications and the challenges for CPT in the treatment of severe COVID-19, paving the way toward vaccine and immunotherapy development.",2020,"Ouyang, Jing; Isnard, Stéphane; Lin, John; Fombuena, Brandon; Peng, Xiaorong; Routy, Jean-Pierre; Chen, Yaokai",Front Immunol

WHO,In silico and In vitro Studies Reveal Complement System Drives Coagulation Cascade in SARS-CoV-2 Pathogenesis,"The emergence and continued spread of SARS-CoV-2 have resulted in a public health emergency across the globe. The lack of knowledge on the precise mechanism of viral pathogenesis is impeding medical intervention. In this study, we have taken both in silico and in vitro experimental approaches to unravel the mechanism of viral pathogenesis associated with complement and coagulation pathways. Based on the structural similarities of viral and host proteins, we initially generated a protein-protein interactome profile. Further computational analysis combined with Gene Ontology (GO) analysis and KEGG pathway analysis predicted key annotated pathways associated with viral pathogenesis. These include MAPK signaling, complement, and coagulation cascades, endocytosis, PD-L1 expression, PD-1 checkpoint pathway in cancer and C-type lectin receptor signaling pathways. Degree centrality analysis pinned down to MAPK1, MAPK3, AKT1, and SRC are crucial drivers of signaling pathways and often overlap with the associated pathways. Most strikingly, the complement and coagulation cascade and platelet activation pathways are interconnected, presumably directing thrombotic activity observed in severe or critical cases of COVID-19. This is complemented by in vitro studies of Huh7 cell infection and analysis of the transcriptome and proteomic profile of gene candidates during viral infection. The most known candidates associated with complement and coagulation cascade signaling by KEGG pathway analysis showed significant up-regulated fold change during viral infection. Collectively both in silico and in vitro studies suggest complement and coagulation cascade signaling are a mechanism for intravascular coagulation, thrombotic changes, and associated complications in severe COVID-19 patients.",2020,"Tiwari, Ritudhwaj; Mishra, Anurag R; Mikaeloff, Flora; Gupta, Soham; Mirazimi, Ali; Byrareddy, Siddappa N; Neogi, Ujjwal; Nayak, Debasis",

Two hundred and forty scouring lambs, and 25 healthy lambs selected as control, were used in this trial. The faecal samples from the scouring lambs were positive to non-enterotoxigenic E. coli. All the scouring lambs received supportive care and they were randomly allotted to two groups of 120 animals (treated group and untreated group). The lambs in the treated group were given two daily doses of 20 mg/kg live weight spectinomycin for 3 days, while the other group of lambs (untreated group) did not receive any antibiotic. Serum endotoxin was higher in the treated lambs. The combined infection of E. coli + Proteus mirabilis was the most frequent microbiological result in the deceased treated lambs, while the only enteric pathogen isolated in the untreated lambs submitted to necroscopy was E. coli. The pathological findings most commonly recorded in the untreated lambs were suggestive of a generalized inflammatory process attributed to colibacilosis, while the lesions in the treated lambs might correspond to an enterotoxoemic process. The overproduction of P. mirabilis might be consequence of the antibiotic treatment and it would be the most probable cause of the endotoxemia, the high mortality rate and the pathological findings in the treated lambs. Therefore, a supportive care without antibiotics does not lead to a poorer chance of survival in lambs with diarrhoea attributed to non-enterotoxigenic E. coli.",2008-03-05,"Gómez, L.; Andrés, S.; Sánchez, J.; Alonso, J.M.; Rey, J.; López, F.; Jiménez, A.",Small Rumin Res

The biological drivers of AMR are well understood, but factors related to treatment-seeking and the social contexts of antibiotic (AB) use behaviours are less understood. Here we describe the Holistic Approach to Unravelling Antibacterial Resistance in East Africa (HATUA), a multi-centre consortium that investigates the diverse drivers of drug-resistance in urinary tract infections (UTIs) in East Africa. Methods and Analysis: This study will take place in Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. We will conduct geospatial mapping of AB sellers, and conduct mystery client studies and in-depth interviews (IDI) with drug sellers to investigate AB provision practices. In parallel, we will conduct IDIs with doctors, alongside community focus groups. Clinically diagnosed UTI patients will be recruited from healthcare centres, provide urine samples, and complete a questionnaire capturing retrospective treatment pathways, socio-demographic characteristics, attitudes and knowledge. Bacterial isolates from urine and stool samples will be subject to culture and antibiotic susceptibility testing (C&AST). Genomic DNA from bacterial isolates will be extracted with a subset being sequenced. A follow-up household interview will be conducted with 1800 UTI-positive patients, where further environmental samples will be collected. A sub-sample of patients will be interviewed using qualitative tools. Questionnaire data, microbiological analysis and qualitative data will be linked at the individual level. Quantitative data will be analysed using statistical modelling including Bayesian network analysis, and all forms of qualitative data analysed through iterative thematic content analysis. Ethics and Dissemination: Approvals have been obtained from all national and local ethical review bodies in East Africa and the UK.

WHO,Early awake proning in critical and severe COVID-19 patients undergoing noninvasive respiratory support: A retrospective multicenter cohort study,"BACKGROUND/MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective cohort study was conducted in two teaching hospitals over a 3-month period (March 2010-June 2020) comparing severe and critical COVID-19 patients admitted to Respiratory Intensive Care Unit for non-invasive respiratory support (NRS) and subjected to awake prone position (PP) with those receiving standard care (SC). Primary outcome was endotracheal intubation (ETI) rate. In-hospital mortality, time to ETI, tracheostomy, length of RICU and hospital stay served as secondary outcomes. Risk factors associated to ETI among PP patients were also investigated. RESULTS: A total of 114 patients were included, 76 in the SC and 38 in the PP group. Unadjusted Kaplan-Meier estimates showed greater effect of PP compared to SC on ETI rate (HRâ¯=â¯0.45 95% CI [0.2-0.9], pâ¯=â¯0.02) even after adjustment for baseline confounders (HRâ¯=â¯0.59 95% CI [0.3-0.94], pâ¯=â¯0.03). After stratification according to non-invasive respiratory support, PP showed greater significant benefit for those on High Flow Nasal Cannulae (HRâ¯=â¯0.34 95% CI [0.12-0.84], pâ¯=â¯0.04). Compared to SC, PP patients also showed a favorable difference in terms of days free from respiratory support, length of RICU and hospital stay while mortality and tracheostomy rate were not significantly different. CONCLUSIONS: Prone positioning in awake and spontaneously breathing Covid-19 patients is feasible and associated with a reduction of intubation rate, especially in those patients undergoing HFNC.

With the global pandemic, the lack of efficient rapid and accurate molecular diagnostic testing tools has hindered the public opportunely response to the emerging viral threat. Herein, a DNA nanoscaffold hybrid chain reaction (DNHCR)-based nucleic acid assay strategy is reported for rapid detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA. In this method, the DNA nanoscaffolds have been first constructed by the self-assembly of long DNA strands and self-quenching probes (H1). Then, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA will initiate the hybridization of H1 and free H2 DNA probes along the nanoscaffold, and an illuminated DNA nanostring is instantly obtained. By taking advantages of the localization design of the H1 probes and the temperature tolerance of the isothermal amplification, the proposed DNHCR method can detect target at short responding time (within 10 min) and mild condition (15°C–35 °C). Moreover, the reliability of DNHCR method in serum and saliva samples have also been validated.

New detection methods to distinguish DNA from viable cells are required to ensure pharmaceutical product quality and safety. In this study, we have assessed a droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) with a variant propidium monoazide (PMAxx) for selective detection of live/dead BCC cells in autoclaved nuclease-free water after 365 days, in 0.001% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHX), and in 0.005% benzalkonium chloride (BZK) solutions after 184 days. Using 10 μM PMAxx and 5 min light exposure, a proportion of dead BCC was quantified by ddPCR. The detection limit of culture-based method was 10(4) CFU/mL, equivalent to 9.7 pg/μL for B. cenocepacia J2315, while that of ddPCR was 9.7 fg/μL. The true positive rate from nuclease-free water and CHX using PMAxx-ddPCR assay was 60.0% and 38.3%, respectively, compared to 85.0% and 74.6% without PMAxx (p < 0.05), respectively. However, in BZK-treated cells, no difference in the detection rate was observed between the ddPCR assay on samples treated with PMAxx (67.1%) and without PMAxx (63.3%). This study shows that the PMAxx-ddPCR assay provides a better tool for selective detection of live BCC cells in non-sterile pharmaceutical products.",2022-04-30,"Daddy Gaoh, Soumana; Kweon, Ohgew; Lee, Yong-Jin; Hussong, David; Marasa, Bernard; Ahn, Youngbeom",Microorganisms

PMC,Population genomics of Vibrionaceae isolated from an endangered oasis reveals local adaptation after an environmental perturbation,"BACKGROUND: In bacteria, pan-genomes are the result of an evolutionary “tug of war” between selection and horizontal gene transfer (HGT). High rates of HGT increase the genetic pool and the effective population size (N(e)), resulting in open pan-genomes. In contrast, selective pressures can lead to local adaptation by purging the variation introduced by HGT and mutation, resulting in closed pan-genomes and clonal lineages. In this study, we explored both hypotheses, elucidating the pan-genome of Vibrionaceae isolates after a perturbation event in the endangered oasis of Cuatro Ciénegas Basin (CCB), Mexico, and looking for signals of adaptation to the environments in their genomes. RESULTS: We obtained 42 genomes of Vibrionaceae distributed in six lineages, two of them did not showed any close reference strain in databases. Five of the lineages showed closed pan-genomes and were associated to either water or sediment environment; their high N(e) estimates suggest that these lineages are not from a recent origin. The only clade with an open pan-genome was found in both environments and was formed by ten genetic groups with low N(e), suggesting a recent origin. The recombination and mutation estimators (r/m) ranged from 0.005 to 2.725, which are similar to oceanic Vibrionaceae estimations. However, we identified 367 gene families with signals of positive selection, most of them found in the core genome; suggesting that despite recombination, natural selection moves the Vibrionaceae CCB lineages to local adaptation, purging the genomes and keeping closed pan-genome patterns. Moreover, we identify 598 SNPs associated with an unstructured environment; some of the genes associated with these SNPs were related to sodium transport. CONCLUSIONS: Different lines of evidence suggest that the sampled Vibrionaceae, are part of the rare biosphere usually living under famine conditions. Two of these lineages were reported for the first time. Most Vibrionaceae lineages of CCB are adapted to their micro-habitats rather than to the sampled environments. This pattern of adaptation is concordant with the association of closed pan-genomes and local adaptation.",2020-06-22,"Vázquez-Rosas-Landa, Mirna; Ponce-Soto, Gabriel Yaxal; Aguirre-Liguori, Jonás A.; Thakur, Shalabh; Scheinvar, Enrique; Barrera-Redondo, Josué; Ibarra-Laclette, Enrique; Guttman, David S.; Eguiarte, Luis E.; Souza, Valeria",BMC Genomics

Medline,Ultra-Processed Profits: The Political Economy of Countering the Global Spread of Ultra-Processed Foods - A Synthesis Review on the Market and Political Practices of Transnational Food Corporations and Strategic Public Health Responses.,"BACKGROUND Ultra-processed food (UPF) and Ultra-processed beverage (UPB) consumption is associated with higher risks of numerous non-communicable diseases (NCDs). Yet global consumption of these products is rising due to profound changes in production, processing, manufacturing, marketing, retail, and consumption practices, alongside the growth of the resources and political influence of Big Food. Whilst the sales of UPFs and UPBs in high-income countries (HICs) are stagnating, sales are rapidly expanding in more populous middle-income countries (MICs). In this paper, we adopt a political economy of food systems approach to understand how growth of Big Food in MICs drives the NCD pandemic. METHODS We conducted a mixed methods synthesis review. This involved quantitative data collection and development of descriptive statistics; a search for academic, market and grey literature on the expansion of UPF in MICs; and the development of themes, three illustrative case examples (South Africa, Colombia, and Indonesia), and synthesis of the enablers of successful campaigns in MICs into recommendations for public health campaigns. RESULTS We project that the combined sales volume of UPFs in MICs will reach equivalency with HICs by 2024, and the total sales volume of UPBs in MICs is already significantly higher than in HICs. Similarly, annual growth in UPF sales is higher in MICs compared to HICs. We also show how Big Food has entrenched its presence within MICs through establishing global production and hyper-local distribution networks, scaling up its marketing, challenging government policies and scientific expertise, and co-opting civil society. We argue that public health can counter the influence of Big Food by developing an expanded global network of driven and passionate people with diverse skillsets, and advocating for increased government leadership. CONCLUSION The projected increase in sales of UPFs and UPBs in MICs raises major concerns about the global capacity to prevent and treat NCDs.",2021-05-24,"Moodie, Rob; Bennett, Elizabeth; Kwong, Edwin Jit Leung; Santos, Thiago M; Pratiwi, Liza; Williams, Joanna; Baker, Phillip",International journal of health policy and management
PMC,Document Re-ranking by Generality in Bio-medical Information Retrieval,"Document ranking is an important process in information retrieval (IR). It presents retrieved documents in an order of their estimated degrees of relevance to query. Traditional document ranking methods are mostly based on the similarity computations between documents and query. In this paper we argue that the similarity-based document ranking is insufficient in some cases. There are two reasons. Firstly it is about the increased information variety. There are far too many different types documents available now for user to search. The second is about the users variety. In many cases user may want to retrieve documents that are not only similar but also general or broad regarding a certain topic. This is particularly the case in some domains such as bio-medical IR. In this paper we propose a novel approach to re-rank the retrieved documents by incorporating the similarity with their generality. By an ontology-based analysis on the semantic cohesion of text, document generality can be quantified. The retrieved documents are then re-ranked by their combined scores of similarity and the closeness of documents’ generality to the query’s. Our experiments have shown an encouraging performance on a large bio-medical document collection, OHSUMED, containing 348,566 medical journal references and 101 test queries.",2005,"Yan, Xin; Li, Xue; Song, Dawei",Web Information Systems Engineering - WISE 2005

WHO,Histopathological findings and viral tropism in UK patients with severe fatal COVID-19: a post-mortem study,"Background: Severe COVID-19 has a high mortality rate. Comprehensive pathological descriptions of COVID-19 are scarce and limited in scope. We aimed to describe the histopathological findings and viral tropism in patients who died of severe COVID-19. Methods: In this case series, patients were considered eligible if they were older than 18 years, with premortem diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infection and COVID-19 listed clinically as the direct cause of death. Between March 1 and April 30, 2020, full post-mortem examinations were done on nine patients with confirmed COVID-19, including sampling of all major organs. A limited autopsy was done on one additional patient. Histochemical and immunohistochemical analyses were done, and histopathological findings were reported by subspecialist pathologists. Viral quantitative RT-PCR analysis was done on tissue samples from a subset of patients. Findings: The median age at death of our cohort of ten patients was 73 years (IQR 52-79). Thrombotic features were observed in at least one major organ in all full autopsies, predominantly in the lung (eight [89%] of nine patients), heart (five [56%]), and kidney (four [44%]). Diffuse alveolar damage was the most consistent lung finding (all ten patients); however, organisation was noted in patients with a longer clinical course. We documented lymphocyte depletion (particularly CD8-positive T cells) in haematological organs and haemophagocytosis. Evidence of acute tubular injury was noted in all nine patients examined. Major unexpected findings were acute pancreatitis (two [22%] of nine patients), adrenal micro-infarction (three [33%]), pericarditis (two [22%]), disseminated mucormycosis (one [10%] of ten patients), aortic dissection (one [11%] of nine patients), and marantic endocarditis (one [11%]). Viral genomes were detected outside of the respiratory tract in four of five patients. The presence of subgenomic viral RNA transcripts provided evidence of active viral replication outside the respiratory tract in three of five patients. Interpretation: Our series supports clinical data showing that the four dominant interrelated pathological processes in severe COVID-19 are diffuse alveolar damage, thrombosis, haemophagocytosis, and immune cell depletion. Additionally, we report here several novel autopsy findings including pancreatitis, pericarditis, adrenal micro-infarction, secondary disseminated mucormycosis, and brain microglial activation, which require additional investigation to understand their role in COVID-19.

WHO,COVID-19 Impact in Neurosurgery Residency: Grit During Pandemic,"BACKGROUND: The coronavirus disease-19 (COVID) pandemic has presented a significant challenge to health care providers. Neurosurgical patients are often critically ill and at particularly high risk for COVID, and the pandemic has produced ever-shifting circumstances to allow their continued care. This study explores the psychologic impact of the pandemic on neurosurgical residents at a single institution. METHODS: Residents completed the Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) and the Inventory of Depressive Symptomology 30 (IDS-30), two validated surveys, before and during the pandemic. PSS scores range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicative of increased stress. IDS-30 ranges from 0 to 84 with higher scores indicating more severe levels of depression. Survey results were compared collectively among residents and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The surveys had 19 out of 28 total responders (68%). Mean score on the PSS was 16.1 prepandemic and 14.7 during the pandemic (P > 0.05). The mean score on the IDS-30 was 14.7 prepandemic and 12.0 during the pandemic (P > 0.05). Matching the survey questionnaire results by each resident revealed an average decrease of 2.3 and 2.4 for the PSS and IDS-30, respectively.

Furthermore, we distinguish between the impact of the lockdown, which affected the entire territory by mid-March, from the effect of the number of new confirmed positive COVID-19 cases at the municipal level. Our results show strong stockpiling effects for most of the products in the first week of adoption of the lockdown measures. On the other hand, the number of new cases at the municipal level is associated with reductions in sales, pointing towards increased fears of being infected as the main driver of the slowdown in sales.

A tale of photorespiratory mutants, ammonium tolerance and conifers","Agriculture has the great challenge of adapting to a progressively changing climate (including the increase of CO2 levels and temperature), minimizing its environmental impact at the same time that crops yield needs to be maintained or increased to ensure food security. In this scenario increasing plants nitrogen (N) use efficiency and minimizing energy losses coming from photorespiration are long-pursued traits for crops breeding. Plastidic glutamine synthetase (GS2) enzyme stands at the crossroad of N assimilation and photorespiration and thus, appears as a key candidate for the improvement of crops performance. GS2 has been considered for a long time as an essential enzyme for angiosperms survival under photorespiratory conditions. Surprisingly, in Arabidopsis, GS2 is not essential for plant survival and its absence confers tolerance towards ammonium stress, which clashes with the traditional assumption that NH4 + accumulation is a main cause of ammonium stress. Altogether, it appears that the GS2 ""textbook"" view of this enzyme must be revisited, especially regarding: 1) its essentiality for plants growth under photorespiratory conditions and 2) the role of NH4 + assimilation during ammonium stress. In this sense, in this article we open the debate whether ""more or less"" GS2 is a desirable trait for plants productivity.",2022,"Marino, Daniel; Cañas, Rafael A; Betti, Marco",The New phytologist

Three separate piecewise exponential survival models estimated for each solid organ the overall, demographic-specific, and donation service area-specific differences in the hazard of waitlist mortality before and after the national emergency declaration on March 13, 2020. Kidney waiting list mortality was higher after than before the national emergency (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.37; 95% CI, 1.23-1.52). The hazard of waitlist mortality was not significantly different before and after COVID-19 for liver (aHR, 0.94), pancreas (aHR, 1.01), lung (aHR, 1.00), and heart (aHR, 0.94). Kidney candidates had notable variability in differences across donation service areas (aHRs, New York City, 2.52; New Jersey, 1.84; and Michigan, 1.56). The only demographic group with increased waiting list mortality were Blacks versus Whites (aHR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.07-1.86) for kidney candidates.

Medline,Dodging the Bundle - Persistent Healthcare-Associated Rhinovirus Infection throughout the Pandemic.,"INTRODUCTION Healthcare-associated viral infections (HAVI) are a common cause of patient harm in the pediatric population. We implemented a HAVI prevention bundle in 2015, which included 6 core elements: caregiver screening, symptom-based isolation, personal protective equipment (PPE), hand hygiene, staff illness procedures, and monitoring of environmental cleanliness. Enhanced bundle elements were introduced at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, which provided an opportunity to observe the effectiveness of the bundle with optimal adherence to prevention practices, and to measure the impact on respiratory HAVI epidemiology. METHODS Respiratory HAVIs were confirmed through review of medical records and application of the National Health Safety Network (NHSN) surveillance criteria for upper respiratory infections (URIs) with pre-determined incubation periods for unit attribution. Descriptive statistics of the study population were examined, and comparative analyses were performed on demographic and process metrics. Data analysis was conducted using R statistical software. RESULTS We observed an overall decrease in respiratory HAVI of 68%, with pre-pandemic rates of 0.19 infections per 1000 patient significantly decreased to a rate of 0.06 per 1000 patient days in the pandemic period (P<0.01). Rhinovirus made up proportionally more of our respiratory HAVI in the pandemic period (64% vs 53%), with respiratory HAVI secondary only to rhinovirus identified during 8 of 16 months in the pandemic period. Compliance with our HAVI prevention bundle significantly improved during pandemic period. CONCLUSIONS Enhancement of our HAVI bundle during the COVID-19 pandemic contributed toward significant reduction in nosocomial transmission of respiratory HAVI. Even with prevention practices optimized, respiratory HAVIs secondary to rhinovirus continued to be reported, likely due to the capacity of rhinovirus to evade bundle elements in hospital, and infection prevention efforts at large in the community, leaving vulnerable patients at continued risk.",2022-05-16,"Kitt, Eimear; Brennan, Lauren; Harrison, Cecelia; Hei, Hillary; Paul, Elina; Satchell, Lauren; Wilson, Kimberly; Smathers, Sarah; Handy, Lori; Coffin, Susan E",American journal of infection control

Medline,Presenting porous-organic-polymers as next-generation invigorating materials for nanoreactors.,"Porous organic polymers (POPs) represent an emerging class of porous organic materials which mainly comprise organic building blocks that are interconnected via strong covalent bonds, thereby offering highly cross-linked frameworks with rigid structures and specific void spaces for accommodating guest molecules. In the past few years, POPs have garnered colossal research interest as nanoreactors for heterogeneous catalysis (thermal, photochemical, electrochemical, etc.) because of their intriguing characteristic features, such as high thermal and chemical stabilities, adjustable chemical functionalities, large surface areas, and tunable pore size distributions. This feature article provides an overview of existing research relating to diverse POP synthetic approaches (COFs, CTFs, and some amorphous POPs), the possible modification of the functionality of POPs, and their exciting application as next-generation nanoreactors. These POPs are extremely interesting, as they offer the potential for either metal-free or metalated polymer catalysts allowing photocatalytic CO2 reduction to solar-fuel, biofuel upgrades, the conversion of waste cooking oil to bio-oil, and clean H2 production from water, addressing many scientific and technological challenges and providing new opportunities for various specific topics in catalysis. Finally, we emphasize that the integration of various synthetic approaches and the application of POPs as nanoreactors will provide opportunities in the near future for the precision synthesis of functional materials with significant impact in both basic and applied research areas.",2021-08-09,"Sarkar, Chitra; Shit, Subhash Chandra; Das, Nitumani; Mondal, John",Chemical communications
WHO,COVID-19 screening test by using random oropharyngeal saliva,"An optimal clinical specimen for accurate detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by minimizing the usage of consumables and reduce hazard exposure to healthcare workers is an urgent priority. The diagnostic performance of SARS-CoV-2 detection between healthcare worker-collected nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal (NP + OP) swabs and patient performed self-collected random saliva was assessed. Paired NP + OP swabs and random saliva were collected and processed within 48 h of specimen collection from two cohort studies which recruited 562 asymptomatic adult candidates. Real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction targeting Open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) and nucleocapsid (N) genes was performed and the results were compared. Overall, 65 of 562 (28.1%) candidates tested positive for COVID-19 based on random saliva, NP + OP swabs, or both testing techniques. The detection rate of SARS-CoV-2 was higher in random saliva compared to NP + OP testing (92.3%; 60/65 vs. 73.8%; 48/65; p < .05). The estimated sensitivity and specificity of random saliva were higher than NP + OP swabs (95.0; 99.9 vs. 72.2; 99.4). The Ct values of ORF1a and N genes were significantly lower in random saliva compared to NP + OP swabs specimens. Our findings demonstrate that random saliva is an alternative diagnostic specimen for the detection of SARS-CoV-2. Self-collected random oropharyngeal saliva is a valuable specimen that provides accurate SARS-CoV-2 surveillance testing of a community.",2021,"Rao, Mohan; Rashid, Fairuz A; Sabri, Fashihah S A H; Jamil, Nur Nadia; Seradja, Valentinus; Abdullah, Nurul A; Ahmad, Hanisah; Aren, S L; Ali, Shareh A S; Ghazali, Mawaddah; Manaf, Anizan A; Talib, Harishah; Hashim, Rohaidah; Zain, Rozainanee; Thayan, Ravindran; Amran, Fairuz; Aris, Tahir; Ahmad, Norazah",J Med Virol

Medline,A comparison of bats and rodents as reservoirs of zoonotic viruses: are bats special?,"Bats are the natural reservoirs of a number of high-impact viral zoonoses. We present a quantitative analysis to address the hypothesis that bats are unique in their propensity to host zoonotic viruses based on a comparison with rodents, another important host order. We found that bats indeed host more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents, and we identified life-history and ecological factors that promote zoonotic viral richness. More zoonotic viruses are hosted by species whose distributions overlap with a greater number of other species in the same taxonomic order (sympatry). Specifically in bats, there was evidence for increased zoonotic viral richness in species with smaller litters (one young), greater longevity and more litters per year. Furthermore, our results point to a new hypothesis to explain in part why bats host more zoonotic viruses per species: the stronger effect of sympatry in bats and more viruses shared between bat species suggests that interspecific transmission is more prevalent among bats than among rodents. Although bats host more zoonotic viruses per species, the total number of zoonotic viruses identified in bats (61) was lower than in rodents (68), a result of there being approximately twice the number of rodent species as bat species. Therefore, rodents should still be a serious concern as reservoirs of emerging viruses. These findings shed light on disease emergence and perpetuation mechanisms and may help lead to a predictive framework for identifying future emerging infectious virus reservoirs.",2013,"Luis, Angela D; Hayman, David T S; O'Shea, Thomas J; Cryan, Paul M; Gilbert, Amy T; Pulliam, Juliet R C; Mills, James N; Timonin, Mary E; Willis, Craig K R; Cunningham, Andrew A; Fooks, Anthony R; Rupprecht, Charles E; Wood, James L N; Webb, Colleen T",Proceedings.

Elsevier; PMC,Understanding the Chinese-Speaking Economies,"The term ‘Greater China’ is defined in this chapter as one which includes Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau, and mainland China. There have been different names for the greater China area, such as ‘the Chinese circle’, ‘the Chinese community’, ‘the greater China community’, ‘China economic circle’, ‘Chinese economic area’, ‘China economic zone’, and so on. Probably first used by George Cressey at least as far back as the 1930s, the term ‘Greater China’ was to refer to the entire Chinese empire, as opposed to China proper (Harding, 1993, p. 660). The term ‘Greater China’ is now generally used for referring to the cultural and economic ties between the relevant territories, and is not intended to imply sovereignty. Sometimes, to avoid any political connotation, the term Chinese-speaking world is often used instead of the Greater China. Despite the common historical, cultural, and linguistic homogeneity, the greater China economic area has followed different routes of economic developments. Hong Kong and Macau have been under the colonial administrations of the UK and of Portugal, respectively. Taiwan was a Japanese colony between 1895 and 1945 and, following a short period of reunification with mainland China, has been operating independently from the rest of the world. As a result, significant social and economic differences have been present in the four parts of the area, especially since 1949. The Taiwan Strait became a forbidden boundary in 1949 when the Nationalist-led government fled to Taiwan and, at the same time, the Communist-led government was founded on the mainland. Since then, Taiwan and mainland China have been two divergent regimes. Against the common cultural and linguistic homogeneity, mainland China chose essentially to pursue a socialist line, while Taiwan followed the route of market-oriented capitalism. Furthermore, the two sides have also treated each other antagonistically, particularly during the high tide of military confrontation, when the mainland claimed that it would liberate the Taiwan compatriots from the black society sooner or later, while in turn Taiwan maintained that they would use the ‘three democratisms’ to reoccupy the mainland eventually. The Chinese people have a long history of migrating overseas. One of the migrations dates back to the Ming dynasty when Zheng He (1371–1435) became the envoy of the Ming emperor. He sent people – many of them Cantonese and Hokkien – to explore and trade in the South China Sea and in the Indian Ocean. Different waves of immigration led to subgroups among overseas Chinese such as the new and old immigrants in Southeast Asia, North America, Oceania, the Caribbean, Latin America, South Africa, and Russia. From the mid-nineteenth century onward, emigration has been directed primarily to Western countries (such as Australia, Brazil, Canada, New Zealand, the United States, and Western Europe). Many of these emigrants were themselves overseas Chinese or were from Taiwan or Hong Kong, particularly from the 1950s to the 1970s, a period during which the PRC placed severe restrictions on the movement of its citizens. In 1984, Britain agreed to transfer the sovereignty of Hong Kong to the PRC; this triggered another wave of migration to the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, USA, Latin America, and the other parts of the world. The Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 further accelerated the migration. The wave calmed after Hong Kong’s transfer of sovereignty in 1997. In addition, many citizens of Hong Kong hold citizenships or have current visas in other countries so if the need arises, they can leave Hong Kong at short notice.

PMC,DEA allows buprenorphine inductions based on telephone only,"Last week, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) said opioid treatment programs (OTPs) and Drug Addiction Treatment Act (DATA)–waived prescribers can treat new patients with buprenorphine based on a telephone call only. The Controlled Substances Act (CSA), enforced by the DEA, requires all new patients being treated with controlled substances to have an in‐person — or, for now, telemedicine — physical exam. Now, however, because of the coexisting COVID‐19 pandemic and opioid overdose crisis, the DEA has dropped this requirement. This follows the decision of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) to allow exemptions from the OTP take‐home regulations allowing stable patients to be given 14 or 28 days of methadone doses, instead of coming in more frequently (see DEA, SAMHSA relax OTP/OBOT regulations due to COVID‐19, ADAW March 23, https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adaw.32664).",2020-04-03,"Knopf, Alison",

Medline; PMC,How Do Social Structures Become Taken for Granted? Social Reproduction in Calm and Crisis,"This paper identifies experiential processes through which social structures become taken for granted, termed processes of “structure marginalization”. Passive processes of structure marginalization relegate social structures to the margin of experience without the use of higher-order cognitive acts such as evaluation and reflection. Examples include adapting to social structures via routine and habitual practices (material reification), a lack of conscious awareness of the complexity, historical formation, and other details of social structures (ignorance), and rendering social structures irrelevant when they are unreflectively judged to be of no value for achieving ends (nullification). Active processes of structure marginalization reflectively and discursively relegate social structures to marginal consciousness. Examples include the use of naturalistic and necessitarian explanations for the social order that implicitly justify it as inalterable or “just the way things are” (discursive reification), normative justifications for the status quo (legitimation), and conscious awareness of one’s powerlessness to control social-structural conditions (helplessness). Active processes of structure marginalization originate in passive processes. The goal of the typology is to explain, at the level of experience, why social structures typically remain unproblematic and unnoticed in everyday life, even during periods of social crisis and change or when existing structures produce harmful effects.",2021-07-06,"Gunderson, Ryan",Hum Stud

Public compliance poses a challenge when implementing large-scale social restrictions, and various factors have contributed to public non-compliance with the regulation. This study aimed to determine the degree of non-compliance and identify the factors that contributed to public non-compliance with the PSBB in Greater Jakarta, Indonesia. METHODS: This was a quantitative study with a cross-sectional design. A total of 839 residents of Greater Jakarta participated in this study. Data were collected online using a Google Form, and convenience sampling was undertaken. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to explore the relationships between public non-compliance with the PSBB regulation and socio-demographic variables, respondents’ opinion of the PSBB, and social capital. RESULTS: A total of 22.6% of subjects reported participating in activities that did not comply with the PSBB. The variables that most affected non-compliance with the PSBB were age, gender, income, opinion of the PSBB, and social capital. CONCLUSIONS: Strengthening social capital and providing information about COVID-19 prevention measures, such as washing one’s hands with soap, wearing masks properly, and maintaining social distancing, is essential. Robust public understanding will foster trust and cooperation with regard to COVID-19 prevention efforts and provide a basis for mutual agreement regarding rules/penalties.",2021-06-24,"Rosha, Bunga Christitha; Suryaputri, Indri Yunita; Irawan, Irlina Raswanti; Arfines, Prisca Petty; Triwinarto, Agus",J Prev Med Public Health
Medline; PMC,The most recent advances in understanding and managing hidradenitis suppurativa,"Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic, inflammatory, recurrent, and debilitating skin disease of the hair follicle unit that typically develops after puberty. HS has a significant negative impact on both the quality of life (QOL) of patients affected by this disease as well as family members and caregivers. However, the pathogenesis of HS is multifactorial and still remains to be fully elucidated, which makes the development of treatments difficult. The last 10 years have seen a surge in HS research, and many new findings have come to light, yet much more remains to be elucidated. Physicians must employ a multidisciplinary approach to maximally address all facets of HS. Clinical characteristics of the disease that differ between females and males as well as across different races and ethnic groups must be considered. Targeted topical, oral, and injectable therapies continue to be developed for HS as a greater understanding of the pathogenesis is reached. However, randomized controlled trials regarding dietary factors that may contribute to HS are needed to meet our patients’ growing concerns and questions about the role of diet in HS pathogenesis. Finally, improved outcome measures are needed to standardize HS severity and grading between physicians and clinical trials, and a more diverse representation of HS populations is needed in clinical trials.",2020-08-26,"Narla, Shanthi; Lyons, Alexis B.; Hamzavi, Iltefat H.",F1000Res
WHO,Glycosylation is a key in SARS-CoV-2 infection,"SARS-CoV-2 causes the respiratory syndrome COVID-19 and is responsible for the current pandemic. The S protein of SARS-CoV-2-mediating virus binding to target cells and subsequent viral uptake is extensively glycosylated. Here we focus on how glycosylation of both SARS-CoV-2 and target cells crucially impacts SARS-CoV-2 infection at different levels: (1) virus binding and entry to host cells, with glycosaminoglycans of host cells acting as a necessary co-factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection by interacting with the receptor-binding domain of the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, (2) innate and adaptive immune response where glycosylation plays both a protective role and contributes to immune evasion by masking of viral polypeptide epitopes and may add to the cytokine cascade via non-fucosylated IgG, and (3) therapy and vaccination where a monoclonal antibody-neutralizing SARS-CoV-2 was shown to interact also with a distinct glycan epitope on the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These evidences highlight the importance of ensuring that glycans are considered when tackling this disease, particularly in the development of vaccines, therapeutic strategies and serological testing.",2021,"Reis, Celso A; Tauber, Rudolf; Blanchard, Véronique",J Mol Med (Berl)
Medline; PMC,Whom Should Be Saved? A Proposed Ethical Framework for Allocating Scarce Medical Resources to COVID-19 Patients Using Fuzzy Logic,"COVID-19 is a global pandemic that affected the everyday life activities of billions around the world. It is an unprecedented crisis that the modern world had never experienced before. It mainly affected the economic state and the health care system. The rapid and increasing number of infected patients overwhelmed the healthcare infrastructure, which causes high demand and, thus, shortage in the required staff members and medical resources. This shortage necessitates practical and ethical suggestions to guide clinicians and medical centers when allocating and reallocating scarce resources for and between COVID-19 patients. Many studies proposed a set of ethical principles that should be applied and implemented to address this problem. In this study, five different ethical principles based on the most commonly recommended principles and aligned with WHO guidelines and state-of-the-art practices proposed in the literature were identified, and recommendations for their applications were discussed. Furthermore, a recent study highlighted physicians' propensity to apply a combination of more than one ethical principle while prioritizing the medical resource allocation. Based on that, an ethical framework that is based on Fuzzy inference systems was proposed. The proposed framework's input is the identified ethical principles, and the output is a weighted value (per patient). This value can be used as a rank or a priority factor given to the patients based on their condition and other relevant information, like the severity of their disease status. The main idea of implementing fuzzy logic in the framework is to combine more than one principle when calculating the weighted value, hence mimicking what some physicians apply in practice. Moreover, the framework's rules are aligned with the identified ethical principles. This framework can help clinicians and guide them while making critical decisions to allocate/reallocate the limited medical resources during the current COVID-19 crisis and future similar pandemics.",2021-03-22,"Saadeh, Heba; Saadeh, Maha; Almobaideen, Wesam",Front Med (Lausanne)

WHO,Endocrine and metabolic aspects of COVID-19,"The paper presents the theoretical considerations on the role of endocrine and metabolic alterations accompanying COVID-19 infection. These alterations may be presumed on the basis of the following two observations. Firstly, the virus SARS-CoV-2 responsible for the COVID-19 infection uses an important renin-angiotensin system (RAS) element - angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) - as a receptor protein for entry into target cells and, in consequence, disturbs the function of the main (circulating) renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) and of the local renin-angiotensin system localized in different tissues and organs. The binding of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2 leads to the downregulation of this enzyme and, in the aftermath, to the excess of angiotensin II and aldosterone. Thus, in the later stage of COVID-19 infection, the beneficial effects of ACEI and ARB could be presumed. It is hypothesized that the local RAS dysregulation in the adipose tissue is the main cause of the negative role of obesity as a risk factor of severe outcome of the COVID-19 infection. Secondly, the outcome of COVID-19 strongly depends on the age of the patient. Age-related hormonal deficiencies, especially those of melatonin and dehydroepiandrosterone, may contribute to morbidity/mortality in older people. The usefulness of melatonin and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors/angiotensin receptor 1 blockers (the latter only in later phases of the infection) as adjuvant drugs is probable but needs thorough clinical trials.",2021,"Pawlikowski, Marek; Winczyk, Katarzyna",Endokrynol Pol

ArXiv,Adaptive Aggregation For Federated Learning,"Advances in federated learning (FL) algorithms,along with technologies like differential privacy and homomorphic encryption, have led to FL being increasingly adopted and used in many application domains. This increasing adoption has led to rapid growth in the number, size (number of participants/parties) and diversity (intermittent vs. active parties) of FL jobs. Many existing FL systems, based on centralized (often single) model aggregators are unable to scale to handle large FL jobs and adapt to parties' behavior. In this paper, we present a new scalable and adaptive architecture for FL aggregation. First, we demonstrate how traditional tree overlay based aggregation techniques (from P2P, publish-subscribe and stream processing research) can help FL aggregation scale, but are ineffective from a resource utilization and cost standpoint. Next, we present the design and implementation of AdaFed, which uses serverless/cloud functions to adaptively scale aggregation in a resource efficient and fault tolerant manner. We describe how AdaFed enables FL aggregation to be dynamically deployed only when necessary, elastically scaled to handle participant joins/leaves and is fault tolerant with minimal effort required on the (aggregation) programmer side. We also demonstrate that our prototype based on Ray scales to thousands of participants, and is able to achieve a>90% reduction in resource requirements and cost, with minimal impact on aggregation latency.",2022-03-23,"Jayaram, K.

METHODS: In this study, 144 puerperants with gestational hypertension admitted to our hospital were included and divided into a research group and a control group according to the nursing method. The control group (n = 72) adopted the routine nursing and the observation group (n = 72) adopted the high-quality nursing. The rate of postpartum hemorrhage, the incidence of eclampsia, the amount of 1 d-postpartum hemorrhage, the quality of life (QOL), the psychological states, and the nursing satisfaction were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: The rate of postpartum hemorrhage, the incidence of eclampsia, and the amount of 1 d-postpartum hemorrhage of the patients in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group (all P < 0.05). After intervention, the scores of psychological states in both groups decreased, which dropped more in the observation group (all P < 0.05). The scores of physical function, overall health, social function, and emotional role in the observation group were significantly higher than those in the control group (all P < 0.05). The patients' satisfaction on nursing in the observation group was significantly higher than that in the control group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: High-quality nursing has certain advantages in improving postpartum hemorrhage and QOL in puerperants with gestational hypertension.

However, to our knowledge, association of COVID-19 with bradycardia has not been reported. This case study describes sinus bradycardia as a potential manifestation of COVID-19. This is a retrospective case series of four patients with laboratory-confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, admitted to St. Luke’s University Health Network ICU between 24 March 2020 and 5 April 2020. Medical records of these patients were reviewed using the EPIC electronic health record system. Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and treatment data were reviewed against periods of bradycardia in each patient. The patient group comprised two males and two females. Two patients had pre-existing cardiovascular (CV) comorbidities but no history of arrythmias. Heart rates ranged between 66 and 88 beats/min on admission. The lowest rates during bradycardia were between 42 and 49 beats/min. The onset of sinus bradycardia in patients 1, 2, and 3 were day nine, 15, and five of illness, respectively. Patient 4 had three episodes of bradycardia, starting on day 10 of illness. Patients’ bradycardia episodes lasted one to 14 days. During bradycardia, maximum body temperatures ranged between 99.9 and 100.2 degree Fahrenheit. Patients 2, 3, and 4 required vasopressors to maintain mean arterial pressure > 65 mmHg during episodes. All four patients were on propofol at some point during bradycardia with patients 1, 2, and 3 also receiving dexmedetomidine. There was no consistent correlation of these medications with bradycardia. Electrocardiogram (ECG) findings included sinus bradycardia. Prolonged QTc interval observed in patient 2 on admission improved during bradycardia. Transient sinus bradycardia is a possible manifestation of COVID-19 and is important for close CV surveillance. Etiology can be multifactorial, but severe hypoxia, inflammatory damage of cardiac pacemaker cells, and exaggerated response to medications are possible triggers. High levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines may act directly on the sinoatrial (SA) node contributing to the development of bradycardia. This may be a warning sign of the onset of a serious cytokine storm. An increased awareness of possible exaggerated bradycardia response is important to consider with the use of empiric medications which have arrhythmogenic effects.",2020-06-13,"Amaratunga, Eluwana A; Corwin, Douglas S; Moran, Lynn; Snyder, Richard",Cureus
Medline; PMC,The impact of the COVID‐19 pandemic on the short‐term survival of patients with cancer in Northern Portugal,"The COVID‐19 pandemic led to potential delays in diagnosis and treatment of cancer patients, which may negatively affect the prognosis of these patients. Our study aimed to quantify the impact of COVID‐19 on the short‐term survival of cancer patients by comparing a period of 4 months after the outbreak began (2 March 2020) with an equal period from 2019. All cancer cases of the esophagus, stomach, colon and rectum, pancreas, lung, skin‐melanoma, breast, cervix, and prostate, from the Portuguese Oncology Institute of Porto (IPO‐Porto) and diagnosed between 2 March and 1 July of 2019 (before COVID‐19) and 2020 (after COVID‐19) were identified. Information regarding sociodemographic, clinical and treatment characteristics were collected from the cancer registry database and clinical files. Vital status was assessed to 31 October of the respective years. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate crude and propensity score‐adjusted hazards ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) of death. During follow‐up to 31 October, there were 154 (11.8%) deaths observed before COVID‐19 and 131 (17.2%) after COVID‐19, corresponding to crude and adjusted HRs (95% CI) of 1.51 (1.20‐1.91) and 1.10 (0.86‐1.40), respectively. Significantly higher adjusted hazards of death were observed for patients with Stage III cancer (HR = 2.37; 95% CI: 1.14‐4.94) and those undergoing surgical treatment (HR = 3.97; 95% CI: 1.14‐13.77) or receiving radiotherapy (HR = 1.96; 95% CI: 1.96‐3.74), while patients who did not receive any treatment had a lower mortality hazards (HR = 0.62; 95% CI: 0.46‐0.83). The higher overall short‐term mortality observed during the COVID‐19 pandemic largely reflects the effects of the epidemic on the case‐mix of patients being diagnosed with cancer.",2021-03-13,"Morais, Samantha; Antunes, Luís; Rodrigues, Jéssica; Fontes, Filipa; Bento, Maria José; Lunet, Nuno",Int J Cancer
ArXiv; Medline; PMC; WHO,"Incentives, lockdown, and testing: from Thucydides’ analysis to the COVID-19 pandemic","In this work, we provide a general mathematical formalism to study the optimal control of an epidemic, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, via incentives to lockdown and testing. In particular, we model the interplay between the government and the population as a principal–agent problem with moral hazard, à la Cvitanić et al. (Finance Stoch 22(1):1–37, 2018), while an epidemic is spreading according to dynamics given by compartmental stochastic SIS or SIR models, as proposed respectively by Gray et al. (SIAM J Appl Math 71(3):876–902, 2011) and Tornatore et al. (Phys A Stat Mech Appl 354(15):111–126, 2005). More precisely, to limit the spread of a virus, the population can decrease the transmission rate of the disease by reducing interactions between individuals. However, this effort—which cannot be perfectly monitored by the government—comes at social and monetary cost for the population. To mitigate this cost, and thus encourage the lockdown of the population, the government can put in place an incentive policy, in the form of a tax or subsidy. In addition, the government may also implement a testing policy in order to know more precisely the spread of the epidemic within the country, and to isolate infected individuals. In terms of technical results, we demonstrate the optimal form of the tax, indexed on the proportion of infected individuals, as well as the optimal effort of the population, namely the transmission rate chosen in response to this tax. The government’s optimisation problems then boils down to solving an Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman equation. Numerical results confirm that if a tax policy is implemented, the population is encouraged to significantly reduce its interactions. If the government also adjusts its testing policy, less effort is required on the population side, individuals can interact almost as usual, and the epidemic is largely contained by the targeted isolation of positively-tested individuals.",2022-04-10,"Hubert, Emma; Mastrolia, Thibaut; Possamaï, Dylan; Warin, Xavier",J Math Biol

PMC; WHO,777 Prehospital ECG in patients with acute myocardial infarction during the COVID-19 pandemic,"AIMS: Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) represents the preferred revascularization strategy among patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). A decline in the rates of primary PCI has been observed globally during the outbreak of coronavirus disease-19 (COVID-19). Fear of exposure to in-hospital infection has been hypothesized as the main mechanism of this phenomenon, also contributing to a delayed presentation of patients with STEMI. However, a formal assessment of initial electrocardiograms (ECGs) among STEMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic is still lacking. We therefore compared pre-hospital ECGs of STEMI patients hospitalized in Italy after the first reported case of COVID-19 on 21 February 2020 with data from the same period in 2019 to identifying potential changes between the two periods. METHODS AND RESULTS: Prehospital ECGs were obtained from the STEMI care network in the Campania region. Deidentified ECGs were analysed by two expert reviewers who were blinded to date of recording. Pathological Q-waves were defined as a Q-wave with a duration ≥40 ms and/or depth ≥25% of the R-wave in the same lead or the presence of a Q-wave equivalent. These criteria have been shown to be associated with final infarct size at cardiac magnetic resonance. For all conventional STEMI, the timing of STEMI onset was estimated with the Anderson-Wilkins (AW) acuteness score, ranging from 1 (least acute) to 4 (most acute). From 21 February 2020 to 16 April 2020, a total of 3239 pre-hospital ECGs were recorded by the emergency medical system and 167 (5.15%) were classified as STEMI. During the same period in 2019, 3505 pre-hospital ECGs were recorded, and 196 (5.59%) were classified as STEMI. There was no difference between the two study periods in terms of age, gender, type, and location of STEMI (Table 1). Pathological Q-waves were present in 54.5% of ECGs recorded during the COVID-19 period compared with 22.1% of ECGs recorded in the same period in 2019 (risk difference 32.3, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 21.2–43.5 percentage points). There was also an increase in the mean number of Q-waves during the COVID-19 compared with the control period (1.4 vs. 0.9; P < 0.001). These findings remained similar when QS- and qR complexes were analysed separately. Consistently, the AW score was significantly lower during the COVID-19 period (2.4 vs. 2.8; P < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Prehospital ECGs of STEMI patients during the COVID-19 pandemic presented more frequently with signs of late ischemia compared with the equivalent period in 2019. Approximately, one out of two patients had already pathological Q-waves in the initial ECG. The AW acuteness score is superior to patient history (historical timing) in predicting myocardial salvage and mortality after reperfusion in STEMI patients, thus explaining the higher mortality rate and the increased risk of infarct-related complications observed during the COVID-19 pandemic.",2021-12-08,"Leone, Attilio; Avvedimento, Marisa; Angellotti, Domenico; Simonetti, Fiorenzo; Iapicca, Cristina; Verde, Nicola; Manzi, Lina; Canonico, Mario Enrico; Spinelli, Alessandra; Franzone, Anna; Piccolo, Raffaele; Esposito, Giovanni",Eur Heart J Suppl

WHO,"SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19 pandemic) in Nigeria: Multi-institutional survey of knowledge, practices and perception amongst undergraduate veterinary medical students","The novel Coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) is a global pandemic with an increasing public health concern. Due to the non-availability of a vaccine against the disease, non-pharmaceutical interventions constitute major preventive and control measures. However, inadequate knowledge about the disease and poor perception might limit compliance. This study examined COVID-19-related knowledge, practices, perceptions and associated factors amongst undergraduate veterinary medical students in Nigeria. A cross-sectional web survey was employed to collect data from 437 consenting respondents using pre-tested self-administered questionnaire (August 2020). Demographic factors associated with the knowledge and adoption of recommended preventive practices towards COVID-19 were explored using multivariate logistic regression at P &#8804; 0.05. The respondents' mean knowledge and practice scores were 22.7 (SD ± 3.0) and 24.1 (SD ± 2.9), respectively with overall 63.4% and 88.8% displaying good knowledge and satisfactory practice levels. However, relatively lower proportions showed adherence to avoid touching face or nose (19.5%), face mask-wearing (58.1%), and social distancing (57.4%). Being in the 6th year of study (OR = 3.18, 95%CI: 1.62-6.26, P = 0.001) and female (OR = 2.22, 95% CI = 1.11-4.41, P = 0.024) were significant positive predictors of good knowledge and satisfactory practices, respectively. While only 30% of the respondents perceived the pandemic as a scam or a disease of the elites (24.0%), the respondents were worried about their academics being affected negatively (55.6%). Veterinary Medical Students in Nigeria had good knowledge and satisfactory preventive practices towards COVID-19; albeit with essential gaps in the key non-pharmaceutical preventive measures recommended by the WHO.

One of the most affected economic sectors was the cultural one, especially independent artists, whose financial stability is usually inconsistent. The aim of this article was to test the immediate reactions of the cultural sector, both public and private, to the pandemic shock and, implicitly, to the restrictions imposed during the state of emergency in Romania (27 February–14 May 2020). By using grounded theory, 36 public documents of cultural stakeholders were coded and analyzed. All documents were identified in the Romanian online environment during the state of emergency. Based on the identified interrelationships, it was found that the independent contractors, self-employed workers in the creative-cultural sector, whether or not associated with NGOs or employees of public institutions, need financial and community support.

PMC,Identification of key proteins in the signaling crossroads between wound healing and cancer hallmark phenotypes,"Wound healing (WH) and cancer seem to share common cellular and molecular processes that could work in a tight balance to maintain tissue homeostasis or, when unregulated, drive tumor progression. The “Cancer Hallmarks” comprise crucial biological properties that mediate the advancement of the disease and affect patient prognosis. These hallmarks have been proposed to overlap with essential features of the WH process. However, common hallmarks and proteins actively participating in both processes have yet to be described. In this work we identify 21 WH proteins strongly linked with solid tumors by integrated TCGA Pan-Cancer and multi-omics analyses. These proteins were associated with eight of the ten described cancer hallmarks, especially avoiding immune destruction. These results show that WH and cancer's common proteins are involved in the microenvironment modification of solid tissues and immune system regulation.

Factors associated with the outbreak and lockdown can exacerbate CHF. METHODS AND RESULTS: We analysed the answers of 124 randomly selected CHF outpatients (mean age 71.0 ± 14.0 years, 60.5% male) interviewed by phone during the sixth and seventh weeks of the lockdown. Most patients were treated for New York Heart Association class II (38.7%) and reduced ejection fraction HF (70.2%). Psychological distress (Kessler 6 score ≥ 5) was common (18.5%), and 21.8% felt worse than before the lockdown. Few patients (n = 10) adjusted their intake of HF medications, always on medical prescription. Decreased physical activity was common (41.9%) and more frequent in women (P = 0.025) and urban dwellers (P = 0.009). Almost half of respondents (46.0%) declared increased screen time, but only few declared more alcohol intake (4.0%). Weight gain was common (27.4%), and 44.4% of current smokers increased tobacco consumption. Adherence to recommended salt or fluid intake restrictions was reduced in 14.5%. Increase in HF symptoms was commonly reported (21.8%) and tended to be higher in women than in men (P = 0.074). Of the 23 patients who had a phone teleconsultation during the pandemic, 16 had initially planned an in‐person consultation that they switched for teleconsultation. CONCLUSIONS: During the lockdown, psychological distress and decreased well‐being were common in CHF outpatients, and there was an increase in unhealthy lifestyle behaviours.

Here we present a pivotal molecular mechanism of viral protein translation that relies on the mitochondrial translation machinery. We found that rare codons such as Leu-TTA are highly enriched in many viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, and these codons are essential for the regulation of viral protein expression. SARS-CoV-2 controls the translation of its spike gene by hijacking host mitochondria through 5’ leader and 3’UTR sequences that contain mitochondrial localization signals and activate the EGR1 pathway. Mitochondrial-targeted drugs such as lonidamine and polydatin significantly repress rare codon-driven gene expression and viral replication.

WHO,Umami: an alternative Japanese approach to reducing sodium while enhancing taste desirability,"COVID-19 has highlighted the underlying global burden from non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and the lack of resiliency in health systems to tackle highly preventable risk factors, which have left populations vulnerable to acute health crises. The persistent issue of unhealthy behaviors, particularly those related to a high-sodium diet, suggests inadequate policy attention and insufficient funding for public health and behavioral research. This year, Japan will host the Tokyo Nutrition for Growth (N4G) Summit 2021.

ArXiv,Pulse of the Pandemic: Iterative Topic Filtering for Clinical Information Extraction from Social Media,"The rapid evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the need to quickly disseminate the latest clinical knowledge during a public-health emergency. One surprisingly effective platform for healthcare professionals (HCPs) to share knowledge and experiences from the front lines has been social media (for example, the""#medtwitter""community on Twitter). However, identifying clinically-relevant content in social media without manual labeling is a challenge because of the sheer volume of irrelevant data. We present an unsupervised, iterative approach to mine clinically relevant information from social media data, which begins by heuristically filtering for HCP-authored texts and incorporates topic modeling and concept extraction with MetaMap. This approach identifies granular topics and tweets with high clinical relevance from a set of about 52 million COVID-19-related tweets from January to mid-June 2020. We also show that because the technique does not require manual labeling, it can be used to identify emerging topics on a week-to-week basis.

Medline; PMC,Medical interns’ reflections on their training in use of personal protective equipment,"BACKGROUND: The current COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that personal protective equipment (PPE) is essential, to prevent the acquisition and transmission of infectious diseases, yet its use is often sub-optimal in the clinical setting. Training and education are important to ensure and sustain the safe and effective use of PPE by medical interns, but current methods are often inadequate in providing the relevant knowledge and skills. The purpose of this study was to explore medical graduates’ experiences of the use of PPE and identify opportunities for improvement in education and training programmes, to improve occupational and patient safety. METHODS: This study was undertaken in 2018 in a large tertiary-care teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia, to explore medical interns’ self-reported experiences of PPE use, at the beginning of their internship. Reflexive groups were conducted immediately after theoretical and practical PPE training, during hospital orientation. Transcripts of recorded discussions were analysed, using a thematic approach that drew on the COM-B (capability, opportunity, motivation - behaviour) framework for behaviour. RESULTS: 80% of 90 eligible graduates participated. Many interns had not previously received formal training in the specific skills required for optimal PPE use and had developed potentially unsafe habits. Their experiences as medical students in clinical areas contrasted sharply with recommended practice taught at hospital orientation and impacted on their ability to cultivate correct PPE use. CONCLUSIONS: Undergraduate teaching should be consistent with best practice PPE use, and include practical training that embeds correct and safe practices.",2020-09-23,"Barratt, Ruth; Wyer, Mary; Hor, Su-yin; Gilbert, Gwendolyn L.",BMC Med Educ
Medline,Influence of prior and visual information on eye movements in amblyopic children.,"This study analyzed the characteristics of pursuit and assessed the influence of prior and visual information on eye velocity and saccades in amblyopic and control children, in comparison to adults. Eye movements of 41 children (21 amblyopes and 20 controls) were compared to eye movements of 55 adults (18 amblyopes and 37 controls). Participants were asked to pursue a target moving at a constant velocity. The target was either a 'standard' target, with a uniform color intensity, or a 'noisy' target, with blurry edges, to mimic the blurriness of an amblyopic eye. Analysis of pursuit patterns showed that the onset was delayed, and the gain was decreased in control children with a noisy target in comparison to amblyopic or control children with a standard target. Furthermore, a significant effect of prior and visual information on pursuit velocity and saccades was found across all participants. Moreover, the modulation of the effect of visual information on the pursuit velocity by group, that is amblyopes or controls with a standard target, and controls with a noisy target, was more limited in children. In other words, the effect of visual information was higher in control adults with a standard target compared to control children with the same target. However, in the case of a blurry target, either in control participants with a noisy target or in amblyopic participants with a standard target, the effect of visual information was larger in children.",2020-09-08,"Hemptinne, Coralie; Deravet, Nicolas; Orban de Xivry, Jean-Jacques; Lefèvre, Philippe; Yüksel, Demet",Journal of computational neuroscience

A Multicentre Report From Tertiary Clinics in Northern Italy,"After the outbreak of Coronavirus disease was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization, this resulted in extraordinary public health measures to control the infection, such as entire countries being placed under quarantine. The psychopathological consequences of the pandemic and quarantine were anticipated to be of particular relevance, especially in patients with psychiatric disorders such as Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD). Aim of the present report was to describe the impact of COVID-19 pandemics within a sample of Italian patients affected by OCD. Sociodemographic and clinical variables of a sample of 123 OCD outpatients, currently attending three OCD tertiary clinics in Northern Italy, were assessed through telephone and in-person interviews. Patients showing a clinical worsening of OCD represented more than one third of the sample and reported a significant emergence of new obsessions and compulsions phenotypes along with a significant exacerbation of past ones. Moreover, they were more frequently found to experience suicidal ideation, increased Internet checking, sleep disturbances, avoidance behaviors, and work difficulties. A significantly increased need of therapy adjustment and family accommodation was also observed. Further research is warranted to clarify the potential risk and related consequences of the current COVID-19 pandemic on OCD patients.",2020,"Benatti, Beatrice; Albert, Umberto; Maina, Giuseppe; Fiorillo, Andrea; Celebre, Laura; Girone, Nicolaja; Fineberg, Naomi; Bramante, Stefano; Rigardetto, Sylvia; Dell’Osso, Bernardo",Front.

WHO,Mitoquinone mesylate targets SARS-CoV-2 and associated lung inflammation through host pathways,"To date, there is no effective oral antiviral against SARS-CoV-2 that is also anti-inflammatory. Herein, we show that the mitochondrial antioxidant mitoquinone/mitoquinol mesylate (Mito-MES), a dietary supplement, has potent antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 and its variants of concern in vitro and in vivo. Mito-MES had nanomolar in vitro antiviral potency against the Beta and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants as well as the murine hepatitis virus (MHV-A59). Mito-MES given in SARS-CoV-2 infected K18-hACE2 mice through oral gavage reduced viral titer by nearly 4 log units relative to the vehicle group. We found in vitro that the antiviral effect of Mito-MES is attributable to its hydrophobic dTPP+ moiety and its combined effects scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS), activating Nrf2 and increasing the host defense proteins TOM70 and MX1. Mito-MES was efficacious reducing increase in cleaved caspase-3 and inflammation induced by SARS-CoV2 infection both in lung epithelial cells and a transgenic mouse model of COVID-19. Mito-MES reduced production of IL-6 by SARS-CoV-2 infected epithelial cells through its antioxidant properties (Nrf2 agonist, coenzyme Q10 moiety) and the dTPP moiety. Given established safety of Mito-MES in humans, our results suggest that Mito-MES may represent a rapidly applicable therapeutic strategy that can be added in the therapeutic arsenal against COVID-19. Its potential long-term use by humans as diet supplement could help control the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, especially in the setting of rapidly emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants that may compromise vaccine efficacy.

There has been little literature thus far on the utility of screening ultrasound and the role of the clinical pharmacist in treating these patients. METHODS: We present a prospective pilot program of thirty-one consecutive COVID-19 patients who were provided four extremity screening ultrasounds for VTE on admission. This was coordinated by a clinical pharmacist as part of a multidisciplinary approach. Quantitative and qualitative data were recorded with the goal of describing the utility of the clinical pharmacist in ultrasound screening. Data collected include demographics, information on clinical symptoms or signs at presentation, and laboratory and radiologic results during the hospitalization from each individual electronic medical record. RESULTS: Nine of the thirty-one patients presented with VTE. Of the nine patients, there were twenty-two total clotted vessels, all of which were asymptomatic. The clinical pharmacist, as the coordinator for a multidisciplinary COVID-19 associated coagulopathy management team, drafted a screening and treatment protocol for anticoagulation prophylaxis and therapy of VTE after ultrasound findings.

WHO,Impact of diabetes in patients waiting for invasive cardiac procedures during COVID-19 pandemic,"BACKGROUND: During COVID-19 pandemic, elective invasive cardiac procedures (ICP) have been frequently cancelled or postponed. Consequences may be more evident in patients with diabetes. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to identify the peculiarities of patients with DM among those in whom ICP were cancelled or postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as to identify subgroups in which the influence of DM has higher impact on the clinical outcome. METHODS: We included 2,158 patients in whom an elective ICP was cancelled or postponed during COVID-19 pandemic in 37 hospitals in Spain. Among them, 700 (32.4%) were diabetics. Patients with and without diabetes were compared. RESULTS: Patients with diabetes were older and had a higher prevalence of other cardiovascular risk factors, previous cardiovascular history and co-morbidities. Diabetics had a higher mortality (3.0% vs. 1.0%; p = 0.001) and cardiovascular mortality (1.9% vs. 0.4%; p = 0.001). Differences were especially important in patients with valvular heart disease (mortality 6.9% vs 1.7% [p < 0.001] and cardiovascular mortality 4.9% vs 0.9% [p = 0.002] in patients with and without diabetes, respectively). In the multivariable analysis, diabetes remained as an independent risk factor both for overall and cardiovascular mortality. No significant interaction was found with other clinical variables.

Medline,Probiotic use in an infectious disease setting.,"INTRODUCTION The lethality of infectious diseases and deep concern over growing antimicrobial resistance make it essential that alternative or adjunct therapies be developed. Areas covered: Using papers published in PubMed, a case is presented to consider beneficial microbes as a means to improve management of infectious diseases. Clinical evidence is mounting that certain probiotic microbes can contribute to this armamentarium. These could have an immediate effect against necrotizing enterocolitis, pre- and post-surgical procedures, antibiotic-associated infections, urogenital infections in women and for reducing the severity and duration of respiratory infections. While further studies will always be warranted irrespective of the intervention, and quality assurance and patient safety must remain a priority, the main barrier to implementation may well be unwarranted hesitation amongst physicians, healthcare administrators and regulators. Meanwhile, patients are already taking things into their own hands at a time when their knowledge of product selection is poor and clinical guidance is invariably missing. Expert commentary: Until vaccines and other alternatives emerge, it would be foolhardy to not use best practices to bring probiotics into mainstream infectious disease management. Our ability to manipulate microbial-host interactions offers hope before the last antibiotic stops being effective.",2017,"Reid, Gregor",Expert review of anti-infective therapy

Medline; PMC,Social and structural determinants of injecting-related bacterial and fungal infections among people who inject drugs: protocol for a mixed studies systematic review,"INTRODUCTION: Injecting-related bacterial and fungal infections are a common complication among people who inject drugs (PWID), associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Invasive infections, including infective endocarditis, appear to be increasing in incidence. To date, preventive efforts have focused on modifying individual-level risk behaviours (eg, hand-washing and skin-cleaning) without much success in reducing the population-level impact of these infections. Learning from successes in HIV prevention, there may be great value in looking beyond individual-level risk behaviours to the social determinants of health. Specifically, the risk environment conceptual framework identifies how social, physical, economic and political environmental factors facilitate and constrain individual behaviour, and therefore influence health outcomes. Understanding the social and structural determinants of injecting-related bacterial and fungal infections could help to identify new targets for prevention efforts in the face of increasing incidence of severe disease. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a protocol for a systematic review. We will review studies of PWID and investigate associations between risk factors (both individual-level and social/structural-level) and the incidence of hospitalisation or death due to injecting-related bacterial infections (skin and soft-tissue infections, bacteraemia, infective endocarditis, osteomyelitis, septic arthritis, epidural abscess and others). We will include quantitative, qualitative and mixed methods studies. Using directed content analysis, we will code risk factors for these infection-related outcomes according to their contributions to the risk environment in type (social, physical, economic or political) and level (microenvironmental or macroenvironmental). We will also code and present risk factors at each stage in the process of drug acquisition, preparation, injection, superficial infection care, severe infection care or hospitalisation, and outcomes after infection or hospital discharge. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: As an analysis of the published literature, no ethics approval is required. The findings will inform a research agenda to develop and implement social/structural interventions aimed at reducing the burden of disease.

This measure permits to identify the markets that are epidemic in their complex interdependence. We conjecture that initially a highly volatile market experiences episodes of risk transmission, but only later absorbs risk and becomes an epidemic market. Moreover, we can detect newly emerging ‘contagion’ in the system. We examine the behaviour of 30 global equity markets and compare spillover measures, which encapsulate many large and small crises episodes. Instead of relying on ex post crisis information, our model identifies crises periods.

The Vision of the new Circular Bio-based Economy, CBE is presented: Unlocking the full potential of all types of sustainably sourced biomass, crop residues, industrial side-streams, and wastes by transforming it into value-added products. The resulting product portfolio consists of a wide spectrum of value-added products, addressing societal and consumer needs. Food and feed, bio-based chemicals, materials, health-promoting products; and bio-based fuels. The pillars of CBE are described, including biotechnology, microbial production, enzyme technology, green chemistry, integrated physical/chemical processing, policies, conducive framework conditions and public private partnerships. Drivers of CBE are analyzed: Biomass supply, biorefineries, value chain clusters, rural development, farmers, foresters and mariners; urgent need for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and stopping biodiversity loss. Improved framework conditions can be drivers but also obstacles if not updated to the era of circularity. Key figures, across the entire BBI-JU project portfolio (2014–2020) are provided, including expansion into biomass feedstocks, terrestrial and aquatic, and an impressive broadening of bio-based product portfolio, including higher-value, health-promoting products for man, animal, plants and soil.

WHO,Understanding seizure risk with wide field fundus photography: Implications for screening guidelines in the era of COVID-19 and telemedicine,"Purpose: To report two cases of photosensitive seizures due to fundus photography flash. Observations: Two patients with seizure history present to a retina clinic for routine follow up. While obtaining imaging, these patients experienced a seizure triggered by fundus camera flash. Conclusions: Fundus photography is essential and ubiquitous amongst optometry and ophthalmology practices, especially in the rising era of telemedicine in the setting of the recent COVID-19 pandemic. To our knowledge, there are no other reports in the literature of seizures triggered by fundus photography flash. However, we believe this to be an under-reported phenomenon and suggest that all eye care providers screen patients for a history of seizures or epilepsy prior to fundus photography.",2020,"Hua, Hong-Uyen; Pieramici, Dante J; Bagheri, Nika",Am J Ophthalmol Case Rep
Medline; PMC; WHO,"Reliably quantifying the evolving worldwide dynamic state of the COVID-19 outbreak from death records, clinical parametrization, and demographic data","The dynamic characterization of the COVID-19 outbreak is critical to implement effective actions for its control and eradication but the information available at a global scale is not sufficiently reliable to be used directly. Here, we develop a quantitative approach to reliably quantify its temporal evolution and controllability through the integration of multiple data sources, including death records, clinical parametrization of the disease, and demographic data, and we explicitly apply it to countries worldwide, covering 97.4% of the human population, and to states within the United States (US). The validation of the approach shows that it can accurately reproduce the available prevalence data and that it can precisely infer the timing of nonpharmaceutical interventions. The results of the analysis identified general patterns of recession, stabilization, and resurgence. The diversity of dynamic behaviors of the outbreak across countries is paralleled by those of states and territories in the US, converging to remarkably similar global states in both cases. Our results offer precise insights into the dynamics of the outbreak and an efficient avenue for the estimation of the prevalence rates over time.",2021-10-07,"Vilar, Jose M.

Medline,Resection of esophageal diverticulum through uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery.,"Open surgery remains the standard strategy for management of esophageal diverticulum in symptomatic patients. However, in the last years an increasing number of minimally invasive approaches have been proposed for this issue in order to reduce the surgical trauma and favor a fast return to daily activity. Herein, we describe a novel technique as uniportal video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) for performing resection of esophageal diverticulum. This procedure was successfully carried out in three consecutive patients with giant mid-esophageal diverticulum (mean size: 6.5±0.5 cm). The mean post-operative time was 121±10 minutes. The chest drain was removed 48 hours later in all cases and the mean length of hospital stay was 9±1 days. No intraoperative neither postoperative complications were found in all patients but one. He had a small fistula 15 days later that was successfully treated with stent insertion. No recurrence of diverticulum was seen in all cases. Uniportal VATS is a feasible procedure that in theory could reduce the surgical trauma compared to standard open approach. However, future prospective studies should corroborate our impression before it can be recommended as acceptable therapy.",2018,"Fiorelli, Alfonso; Izzo, Anna Cecilia; Arrigo, Ettore; Sgalambro, Francesco; Lepore, Maria Antonietta; Cajozzo, Massimo; Castorina, Sergio; Lo Monte, Attilio Ignazio; Santini, Mario; Caronia, Francesco Paolo",Annals of translational medicine

Medline; PMC,Stroke care during the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain: the experience of Spanish stroke units,"BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Spain has been heavily affected by COVID-19. Reallocation of resources for managing the outbreak might have caused a disruption in stroke care. This study analyses the impact on stroke care of reorganising the healthcare system in response to the first COVID-19 outbreak peak in Spain and the strategies adopted by Spanish stroke units to deal with this impact. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We obtained data from a structured survey sent to the responsible of stroke units across the country. We recorded the number of strokes, stroke code activations, intravenous thrombolysis treatments and mechanical thrombectomies during February and March 2019 and 2020. We also collected information on the impact on workflow metrics and on the availability of specialised neurological care and rehabilitation treatments, the characteristics of stroke care for patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact on human resources. We compared the activity data between 2019 and 2020 and the information on activity and impact on stroke care between regions classified according to the disease incidence rate. RESULTS: Fifty-seven (75%) of all stroke units in Spain responded to the survey. There was an overall reduction in admissions for all stroke types during the outbreak’s peak and in the number of stroke code activations and intravenous thrombolysis treatments, results that were independent of the COVID-19 incidence rate. Participants reported a delay in workflow metrics and a reduction of admissions to stroke units, outpatient clinics and rehabilitation therapies. Specific pathways and protocols for managing stroke patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection have been established. CONCLUSION: The COVID-19 outbreak has jeopardised all phases of stroke care. As a consequence, some patients with stroke did not receive adequate treatment.",2020-12-04,"Alonso de Leciñana, María; Castellanos, Mar; Ayo-Martín, Óscar; Morales, Ana",Stroke Vasc Neurol
WHO,Should Firms Promote COVID-19 Vaccination to their Customers? Evidence of Social and Economic Impact from a Natural Experiment in Ridesharing (preprint),"By late 2021, only a fraction of the world’s population had been vaccinated for COVID-19. Governments and firms have invested billions of dollars to urge people to get vaccinated quickly so that economies can remain open. While public health experts have proposed several communication strategies to encourage vaccination, there is limited evidence on the effectiveness of such campaigns, especially when undertaken by the private sector. Furthermore, firms may be hesitant to encourage their customers to vaccinate if they view such initiatives as a pro-social investment with no immediate positive effect on revenues. Using a natural experiment with a ridesharing platform, we find evidence that sharing information about vaccination can have a positive impact on both vaccination rates and firm revenues. Without providing financial incentives such as discounts or promotions, a simple ‘nudge’ can generate demand (trips) as well as motivate a socially beneficial action (getting vaccinated) by providing relevant and timely information (closest vaccine centers, appointment requirements, etc.). Analyzing more than four million customer trips, we found that providing COVID-19 vaccination information led to ~ 60% increase in trips to vaccine centers and an 7.67% increase in ridesharing usage among customers, generating 167 thousand dollars per week in additional revenues for the firm in the focal city. The increases in trips to vaccine centers and in revenues were likely driven by reduced search costs for customers and an increased number of trips taken by customers once fully vaccinated.",2021,"Choudhary, Vivek Liu Zhaoyan Kireyev Pavel Turki Selim Borzdyko Olesya Boutaib Abderrahmane",

Serious complications include pneumonia, and mortality ranges from 2 to 5%. Until March 26, the World Health Organization reports 462 684 confirmed cases and 20 834 deaths worldwide. Dissemination occurs from aerosols or respiratory droplets. Different scientific societies have published clinical practice guidelines regarding ophthalmic care in the COVID-19 pandemic, but the information is presented inconsistently, which makes decision-making difficult. Methods: We conducted a sensitive bibliographic search in EMBASE and ophthalmic society webpages, of the clinical practice guidelines of ophthalmic care in pandemic COVID-19. We extracted the recommendations, organizing them into three categories: ""Which patients to attend"", ""How should the clinic work"", and ""What interventions should be avoided"". For each guideline, we assessed whether the search was systematic and whether the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology was followed. Results: Fourteen relevant articles were found. Fifty-one recommendations were extracted and are shown in a summary table. None are based on a systematic search for evidence, nor do any use GRADE to develop the recommendations. Conclusions: The clinical practice guidelines that we reviewed all recommend rescheduling all non-urgent consultations and surgeries, reinforcing contact precautions, the use of personal protection elements, and the disinfection of surfaces and instruments. The guidelines should be improved by incorporating systematic searches for evidence, using GRADE for recommendations, and Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE II) for reporting.",2020,"Vargas-Peirano, Manuel; Navarrete, Pamela; Díaz, Traccy; Iglesias, Gabriel; Hoehmann, Martin",Medwave

PMC,"Megalocytivirus Induces Complicated Fish Immune Response at Multiple RNA Levels Involving mRNA, miRNA, and circRNA","Megalocytivirus is an important viral pathogen to many farmed fishes, including Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). In this study, we examined megalocytivirus-induced RNA responses in the spleen of flounder by high-throughput sequencing and integrative analysis of various RNA-seq data. A total of 1327 microRNAs (miRNAs), including 368 novel miRNAs, were identified, among which, 171 (named DEmiRs) exhibited significantly differential expressions during viral infection in a time-dependent manner. For these DEmiRs, 805 differentially expressed target mRNAs (DETmRs) were predicted, whose expressions not only significantly changed after megalocytivirus infection but were also negatively correlated with their paired DEmiRs. Integrative analysis of immune-related DETmRs and their target DEmiRs identified 12 hub DEmiRs, which, together with their corresponding DETmRs, formed an interaction network containing 84 pairs of DEmiR and DETmR. In addition to DETmRs, 19 DEmiRs were also found to regulate six key immune genes (mRNAs) differentially expressed during megalocytivirus infection, and together they formed a network consisting of 21 interactive miRNA-messenger RNA (mRNA) pairs. Further analysis identified 9434 circular RNAs (circRNAs), 169 of which (named DEcircRs) showed time-specific and significantly altered expressions during megalocytivirus infection. Integrated analysis of the DETmR-DEmiR and DEcircR-DEmiR interactions led to the identification of a group of competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) constituted by interacting triplets of circRNA, miRNA, and mRNA involved in antiviral immunity. Together these results indicate that complicated regulatory networks of different types of non-coding RNAs and coding RNAs are involved in megalocytivirus infection.",2021-03-19,"Wu, Qian; Ning, Xianhui; Sun, Li",Int J Mol Sci

In Canada, where this study took place, older adults have been encouraged to self-isolate while the rest of the population has been cautioned against in-person contact with them. Prior to COVID-19, social isolation and loneliness among older adults was considered a serious public health concern. Using a series of semi-structured interviews with 26 community-dwelling older adults (65+) living in rural Manitoba, we explore older adults’ experiences of isolation and loneliness in the initial stages of the pandemic between the months of May and July 2020. Participants identified a loss of autonomy, loss of activities and social spaces (e.g., having coffee or eating out, volunteering, and going to church), and lack of meaningful connection at home as factors influencing their sense of isolation and loneliness. Although these loses initially influenced participants’ self-reported isolation and loneliness, the majority developed strategies to mitigate isolation and loneliness, such as drawing on past experiences of isolation, engaging in physically distanced visits, connecting remotely, and “keeping busy.” Our findings call attention to the role of different environments and resources in supporting older adults social and emotional wellbeing, particularly as they adapt to changes in social contact over time.",2021-03-15,"Herron, Rachel V.; Newall, Nancy E.

In addition to face coverings, social distancing, and hand hygiene, an efficient testing method is important to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 in schools. We evaluated the feasibility of a saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction testing program among 18 primary schools in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Qualitative results show that children 4 to 5 years old had difficulty producing an adequate saliva specimen compared to those 6 to 12 years old. Methods: A short training video on saliva collection beforehand helps demystify the process for students and parents alike. Informed consent was challenging yet should be done beforehand by school health nurses or other medical professionals to reassure parents and maximize participation. Results: Telephone interviews with school administrators resulted in an 83% response rate. Overall, 93% of school administrators had a positive experience with saliva testing and felt the program improved the safety of their schools.

Elsevier; Medline; PMC; WHO,Longitudinal monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater using viral genetic markers and the estimation of unconfirmed COVID-19 cases,"In this study, wastewater-based surveillance was carried out to establish the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA concentrations in wastewater and the incidence of corona virus disease 2019 (COVID-19) from clinical testing. The influent wastewater of three major water reclamation facilities (WRFs) in Northern Nevada, serving a population of 390,750, was monitored for SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA gene markers, N1 and N2, from June 2020 through September 2021. A total of 614 samples were collected and analyzed. The SARS-CoV-2 concentrations in wastewater were observed to peak twice during the study period. A moderate correlation trend between coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) incidence data from clinical testing and SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA concentrations in wastewater was observed (Spearman r = 0.533). This correlation improved when using weekly average SARS-CoV-2 marker concentrations of wastewater and clinical case data (Spearman r = 0.790), presumably by mitigating the inherent variability of the environmental dataset and the effects of clinical testing artifacts (e.g., reporting lags). The research also demonstrated the value of wastewater-based surveillance as an early warning signal for early detection of trends in COVID-19 incidence. This was accomplished by identifying that the reported clinical cases had a stronger correlation to SARS-CoV-2 wastewater monitoring data when they were estimated to lag 7-days behind the wastewater data. The results aided local decision makers in developing strategies to manage COVID-19 in the region and provide a framework for how wastewater-based surveillance can be applied across localities to enhance the public health monitoring of the ongoing pandemic.",2022-04-15,"Li, Lin; Mazurowski, Lauren; Dewan, Aimee; Carine, Madeline; Haak, Laura; Guarin, Tatiana C.; Dastjerdi, Niloufar Gharoon; Gerrity, Daniel; Mentzer, Casey; Pagilla, Krishna R.",Sci Total Environ

WHO,Decreased prealbumin level is associated with increased risk for mortality in elderly hospitalized patients with COVID-19,"OBJECTIVES: High-risk patients &#8805;65 y of age with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) tended to have lower serum prealbumin concentrations. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of prealbumin at baseline on COVID-19-related mortality in elderly patients (&#8805;65 y of age). METHODS: We non-selectively and consecutively collected participants from Tongji Hospital in Wuhan from January 17 to February 17, 2020. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were employed to evaluate the correlation between prealbumin and in-hospital outcomes (in-hospital mortality, admission to the intensive care unit [ICU], and mechanical ventilation) in elderly patients with COVID-19. Linear trend was performed by entering the median value of each category of prealbumin tertile as a continuous variable and was visually confirmed by using generalized additive models. Interaction and stratified analyses were conducted as well. RESULTS: We included 446 elderly patients with COVID-19 in the final analyses. In-hospital mortality was 14.79%. Of the 446 patients, 15.47% were admitted to the ICU and 21.3% required mechanical ventilation. Compared with patients in the highest tertile, the prealbumin of patients in the lowest tertile had a 19.09-fold higher risk for death [odds ratio (OR), 20.09; 95% confidence interval (CI), 3.62-111.64; P = 0.0006], 25.39-fold higher risk for ICU admission (OR, 26.39; 95% CI, 4.04-172.39; P = 0.0006), and 1.8-fold higher risk for mechanical ventilation (OR, 2.8; 95% CI, 1.15-6.78; P = 0.0227) after adjustment for potential confounders. There was a linear trend correlation between serum prealbumin concentration and risk for in-hospital mortality, ICU admission, and mechanical ventilation in elderly patients with COVID-19 infection. CONCLUSION: Prealbumin is an independent risk factor of in-hospital mortality for elderly patients with COVID-19.

Medline; PMC,Forecasting patient arrivals at emergency department using calendar and meteorological information,"Overcrowding in emergency departments (EDs) is a serious problem in many countries. Accurate ED patient arrival forecasts can serve as a management baseline to better allocate ED personnel and medical resources. We combined calendar and meteorological information and used ten modern machine learning methods to forecast patient arrivals. For daily patient arrival forecasting, two feature selection methods are proposed. One uses kernel principal component analysis(KPCA) to reduce the dimensionality of all of the features, and the other is to use the maximal information coefficient(MIC) method to select the features related to the daily data first and then perform KPCA dimensionality reduction. The current study focuses on a public hospital ED in Hefei, China. We used the data November 1, 2019 to August 31, 2020 for model training; and patient arrival data September 1, 2020 to November 31, 2020 for model validation. The results show that for hourly patient arrival forecasting, each machine learning model has better forecasting results than the traditional autoRegressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, especially long short-term memory (LSTM) model. For daily patient arrival forecasting, the feature selection method based on MIC-KPCA has a better forecasting effect, and the simpler models are better than the ensemble models.

However, accidents owing to the erroneous programing of infusion pumps caused by users have been consistently reported in several documents. In this study, the authors propose a novel surveillance technique for infusion pumps to continuously monitor the variations in panel digits using a convolutional neural network model, and evaluate the performance of the implemented technique. During the experimental evaluation, 1st-step ROIs and 2nd-step ROIs were successfully extracted from the frame images regardless of the ambient lighting conditions. The final accuracies of the implemented CNN model are 99.9% for both the training (172,800 images) and validation (1080 images) dataset while the final losses for the training and validation datasets are 0.48 and 0.45 after 13th epoch, respectively. In the 24-h continuous monitoring test, the accuracy of the model for volume recognition considering all the 1440 measurements (960 for day-lighting and 480 for night-lighting) is 95.5%, whereas in day-lighting and night-lighting modes the accuracies of the model are 98.2% and 90.0%, respectively. Based on these experimental results, the proposed surveillance technique incorporating infusion pumps is expected to improve the safety of patients who need long-term treatments via infusion pumps, reducing the burden on the nurses and hospitals.",2021-02-21,"Hwang, Young Jun; Kim, Gun Ho; Sung, Eui Suk; Nam, Kyoung Won","Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers.

WHO,DCcov: Repositioning of Drugs and Drug Combinations for SARS-CoV-2 Infected Lung through Constraint-Based Modelling,"The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) became a worldwide pandemic with currently no effective antiviral drug except treatments for symptomatic therapy. Flux balance analysis is an efficient method to analyze metabolic networks. It allows optimizing for a metabolic function and thus e.g., predicting the growth rate of a specific cell or the production rate of a metabolite of interest. Here flux balance analysis was applied on human lung cells infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) to reposition metabolic drugs and drug combinations against the replication of the SARS-CoV-2 virus within the host tissue. Making use of expression data sets of infected lung tissue, genome-scale COVID-19-specific metabolic models were reconstructed. Then host-specific essential genes and gene-pairs were determined through in-silico knockouts that permit reducing the viral biomass production without affecting the host biomass. Key pathways that are associated with COVID-19 severity in lung tissue are related to oxidative stress, as well as ferroptosis, sphingolipid metabolism, cysteine metabolism, and fat digestion. By in-silico screening of FDA approved drugs on the putative disease-specific essential genes and gene-pairs, 45 drugs and 99 drug combinations were predicted as promising candidates for COVID-19 focused drug repositioning (https://github.com/sysbiolux/DCcov). Among the 45 drug candidates, six antiviral drugs were found and seven drugs that are being tested in clinical trials against COVID-19. Other drugs like gemcitabine, rosuvastatin and acetylcysteine, and drug combinations like azathioprine-pemetrexed might offer new chances for treating COVID-19.",2021,"Kishk, Ali Pacheco Maria Pires Sauter Thomas",

WHO,Saving lives by ventilating two patients with specific pressure-controlled ventilation from a single ICU-ventilator during the COVID-19 pandemic,"In late December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 was discovered, which is responsible for a new human disease called COVID-19. Among all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases, 14% were hospitalized, with 2% admitted to intensive care units (ICU) with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring mechanical ventilation [1]. SARS-CoV-2 has spread quickly across the world, with more than one hundred million confirmed cases and more than 2,500,000 dead. In March 2020, the Hospital of Valenciennes had to admit hundreds of COVID-19 patients, and its capacity was almost exceeded [2]. More recently, in France, thousands of critically ill patients had to be admitted to ICUs. In Europe, the next wave of COVID-19 pandemic could be more severe than the first one, and we already know that, in the case of increasing numbers of critically ill, some of them will die as a result of the unavailability of mechanical ventilators [3]. This shortage may be lessened if one ventilator could service more than one patient. The main worry is that this concept could be not useful and systematically deleterious for the patient. Some concepts have already been proposed to ventilate differently two circuits with a single ventilator, with several limitations like the lack of individualization of ventilation of each circuit [4-6]. More recently, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, Clarke et al. [7] described a new concept able to deliver specific ventilation for two different lung tests with a single ventilator. Again, Levin et al. [8] have recently shown that a similar concept of differential ventilation using a single ventilator with flow control valves is feasible in humans.",2021,"Hureau, Maxence; Versyck, Maaike; Fontainre, Sylvie; Lambiotte, Fabien; El Beki, Nabil; Saint Leger, Piehr",Anaesthesiol.

Medline; PMC,Characterization of partially observed epidemics through Bayesian inference: application to COVID-19,"We demonstrate a Bayesian method for the “real-time” characterization and forecasting of partially observed COVID-19 epidemic. Characterization is the estimation of infection spread parameters using daily counts of symptomatic patients. The method is designed to help guide medical resource allocation in the early epoch of the outbreak. The estimation problem is posed as one of Bayesian inference and solved using a Markov chain Monte Carlo technique. The data used in this study was sourced before the arrival of the second wave of infection in July 2020. The proposed modeling approach, when applied at the country level, generally provides accurate forecasts at the regional, state and country level. The epidemiological model detected the flattening of the curve in California, after public health measures were instituted. The method also detected different disease dynamics when applied to specific regions of New Mexico.",2020-10-07,"Safta, Cosmin; Ray, Jaideep; Sargsyan, Khachik",Comput Mech

WHO,A simple lung ultrasound protocol for the screening of COVID-19 pneumonia in the emergency department,"The most relevant manifestation of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is interstitial pneumonia. Several lung ultrasound (US) protocols for pneumonia diagnosis are used in clinical practice, but none has been proposed for COVID-19 patients' screening in the emergency department. We adopted a simplified 6-scan lung US protocol for COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis (LUSCOP) and compared its sensitivity with high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in patients suspected for COVID-19, presenting to one Emergency Department from February 21st to March 15th, 2020, during the outbreak burst in northern Italy. Patients were retrospectively enrolled if both LUSCOP protocol and HRCT were performed in the Emergency Department. The sensitivity of LUSCOP protocol and HRCT were compared. COVID-19 pneumonia's final diagnosis was based on real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction from nasal-pharyngeal swab and on clinical data. Out of 150 suspected COVID-19 patients, 131 were included in the study, and 130 had a final diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. The most frequent lung ultrasonographic features were: bilateral B-pattern in 101 patients (77%), B-pattern with subpleural consolidations in 26 (19.8%) and lung consolidations in 2 (1.5%). LUSCOP Protocol was consistent with HRCT in correctly screening 130 out of the 131 COVID-19 pneumonia cases (99.2%). In one case COVID-19 pneumonia was excluded by both HRCT and lung US. LUSCOP protocol showed optimal sensitivity and can be proposed as a simple screening tool for COVID-19 pneumonia diagnosis in the context of outbreak burst areas where prompt isolation of suspected patients is crucial for patients' and operators' safety.",2021,"Dacrema, Alessandro; Silva, Matteo; Rovero, Luca; Vertemati, Valeria; Losi, Giulia; Piepoli, Massimo Francesco; Sacchi, Roberto; Mangiacotti, Marco; Nazerian, Peiman; Pagani, Laura; Tinelli, Valentina; Poggiali, Erika; Bastoni, Davide; Vercelli, Andrea; Magnacavallo, Andrea",Intern. emerg. med
Medline; WHO,Oncologic results of fertility sparing surgery of cervical cancer: An updated systematic review.,"BACKGROUND Several techniques can be proposed as fertility sparing surgery in young patients treated for cervical cancer but uncertaincies remain concerning their outcomes. Analysis of oncological issues is then the first aim of this review in order to evaluate the best strategy. RESULTS Data were identified from searches of MEDLINE, Current Contents, PubMed and from references in relevant articles from January 1987 to 15th of September 2021. We carry out an updated systematic review involving 5862 patients initially selected for fertility-sparing surgery in 275 series. FINDINGS In patients having a stage IB1 disease, recurrence rate/RR in patients undergoing simple conisation/trachelectomy, radical trachelectomy/RT by laparoscopico-vaginal approach, laparotomic or laparoscopic approaches are respectively: 4.1%, 4.7%, 2.4% and 5.2%. In patients having a stage IB2 disease, RR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or RT by laparotomy are respectively 13.2% and 4.8% (p = .0035). After neoadjuvant treatment a simple cone/trachelectomy was carried out in 91 (30%) patients and a radical one in 210 (70%) cases. But the lowest pregnancy rate is observed in patients undergoing RT by laparotomy (36%). CONCLUSIONS The choice between these treatments should be based above all, on objective oncological data that strike a balance for each procedure between the best chances for cure and the fertility results. In patients having a stage IB1 disease, oncological results are quite similar according to the procedure used. In patients having a stage IB2 disease, RT by open approach has the lowest RR.

WHO,Bacterial infections in COVID-19 patients and their possible treatments,"The COVID-19 pandemic, which started in the beginning of 2020 was triggered by a new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections, severely affected various sectors, especially health. The effect of COVID-19 on patients is exacerbated by bacterial co-infections and secondary bacterial infections. There are few studies on how bacterial co-infections and secondary bacterial infections worsen COVID-19 patients, including in Indonesia. Therefore, it is necessary to update and summarize the understanding of bacterial infections characteristics to help optimize the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment decisions. Antibiotics have been used in COVID-19 patients to treat bacterial infections to date, which could contribute to antimicrobial resistance in the future. The review's objective is to summarize bacterial infections in COVID-19 patients and several possible treatments, including antibiotics, phage therapy, probiotics/prebiotics, and nanomedicine for antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) delivery.

Medline; PMC,Enhancing Value and Uptake for Whole-Population Cohorts of Children and Parents: Methods to Integrate Registries into the Generation Victoria Cohort,"Health registries are critical to understanding, benchmarking and improving quality of care for specific diseases and conditions, but face hurdles including funding, bias towards clinical rather than population samples, lack of pre-morbid and outcomes data, and absent cross-registry harmonisation and coordination. Children are particularly under-represented in registry research. This paper lays out novel principles, methods and governance to integrate diverse registries within or alongside a planned children’s mega-cohort to rapidly generate translatable evidence. GenV (Generation Victoria) will approach for recruitment parents of all newborns (estimated 150,000) over two years from mid-2021 in the state of Victoria (population 6.5 million), Australia. Its sample size and population denominator mean it will contain almost all children with uncommon or co-morbid conditions as they emerge over time. By design, it will include linked datasets, biosamples (including from pregnancy), phenotypes and participant-reported measures, all of which will span pre-morbid to long-term outcomes. We provide a vignette of a planned new registry for high-risk pregnancies to illustrate the possibilities. To our knowledge, this is the first paper to describe such a methodology designed prospectively to enhance both the clinical relevance of a large multipurpose cohort and the value and inclusivity of registries in a population.",2021-04-07,"Sung, Valerie; Williams, Katrina; Perlow, Ella; Hu, Yanhong J.; Ahern, Susannah; Said, Joanne M.; Karanatsios, Bill; Hopper, John L.; McNeil, John J.; Donnan, Leo; Goldfeld, Sharon; Wake, Melissa",Children (Basel)

Medline; PMC; WHO,Does Oxidative Stress Management Help Alleviation of COVID-19 Symptoms in Patients Experiencing Diabetes?,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 virus causes novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) with other comorbidities such as diabetes. Diabetes is the most common cause of diabetic nephropathy, which is attributed to hyperglycemia. COVID-19 produces severe complications in people with diabetes mellitus. This article explains how SARS-CoV-2 causes more significant kidney damage in diabetic patients. Importantly, COVID-19 and diabetes share inflammatory pathways of disease progression. SARS-CoV-2 binding with ACE-2 causes depletion of ACE-2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) from blood vessels, and subsequently, angiotensin-II interacts with angiotensin receptor-1 from vascular membranes that produce NADPH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen phosphate) oxidase, oxidative stress, and constriction of blood vessels. Since diabetes and COVID-19 can create oxidative stress, we hypothesize that COVID-19 with comorbidities such as diabetes can synergistically increase oxidative stress leading to end-stage renal failure and death. Antioxidants may therefore prevent renal damage-induced death by inhibiting oxidative damage and thus can help protect people from COVID-19 related comorbidities. A few clinical trials indicated how effective the antioxidant therapy is against improving COVID-19 symptoms, based on a limited number of patients who experienced COVID-19. In this review, we tried to understand how effective antioxidants (such as vitamin D and flavonoids) can act as food supplements or therapeutics against COVID-19 with diabetes as comorbidity based on recently available clinical, preclinical, or in silico studies.",2022-01-13,"Paul, Alok K.; Hossain, Md K.; Mahboob, Tooba; Nissapatorn, Veeranoot; Wilairatana, Polrat; Jahan, Rownak; Jannat, Khoshnur; Bondhon, Tohmina A.; Hasan, Anamul; de Lourdes Pereira, Maria; Rahmatullah, Mohammed",Nutrients

Elsevier; PMC; WHO,TTV Load is Associated with SARS-CoV-2 Vaccination Response in Lung Transplant Recipients,"Purpose Although the currently approved COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, SARS-CoV-2-specific immune responses are diminished in lung transplant recipients (LTR), probably due to immunosuppression (IS). There is currently no marker of IS that can be used to predict vaccination responses. Here, we study if torque tenovirus (TTV) can be used as a predictive marker. Methods The humoral response to the mRNA-1273 vaccine was assessed in 103 LTR, who were vaccinated 4 to 237 months after Lung transplantation. Spike (S)-specific IgG levels were measured at baseline, 28 days after first, and 28 days after the second vaccination. TTV loads were determined by RT-PCR and Pearson's correlation coefficient was calculated to correlate serological responses to TTV load. Results Humoral responses to the vaccine COVID-19 vaccination were found in 41/103 (40%) LTR at 28 days after the second vaccination. 62 /103 (60%) had no detectable antibodies. TTV loads at baseline correlated with S-specific antibodies and the percentage of responders (=<0.001) (Fig 1). TTV loads also strongly correlated with the time since transplantation, indicating that participants with lower TTV loads were longer after transplantation. Conclusion This study shows an association between baseline TTV load and mRNA-1273-induced S-specific antibodies. If the TTV load is indeed a predictor of vaccination responses, this can be used in the future as a potential guidance for optimizing vaccination regimens. Therefore, we recommend that TTV load measurements are included in further vaccination efficacy studies in immunocompromised cohorts.",2022-04-30,"Verschuuren, E. A.; Hoek, R.; de Vries, R.

MedRxiv; WHO,SARS-CoV-2 infection drives a glycan switch of peripheral T cells at diagnosis,"COVID-19 is a highly selective disease in which SARS-CoV-2 infection can result in different clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic/mild to severe disease that requires hospitalization. Here, we demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection results in a glycosylation reprogramming of circulating lymphocytes at diagnosis. We identified a specific glycosignature of T cells, defined upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and apparently triggered by a serological factor. This specific glycan switch of T cells is detected at diagnosis being more pronounced in asymptomatic patients. We further demonstrated that asymptomatic patients display an increased expression of a viral-sensing receptor, through the up-regulation of DC-SIGN in monocytes. We showed that higher levels of DC-SIGN in monocytes at diagnosis correlates with better COVID-19 prognosis. These new evidences pave the way to the identification of a novel glycan-based response in T cells that may confer protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection in asymptomatic patients, highlighting a novel prognostic biomarker and potential therapeutic target.",2021-02-22,"Alves, I.; Vicente, M.

Medline; WHO,Prevalence of Sclerotic Pterygoid Plate in Pretreatment Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma,"OBJECTIVES: The objective of our study was to determine the prevalence of sclerotic pterygoid plate in pretreatment CT of nasopharyngeal carcinoma compared with the control group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 51 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients (37 men, 14 women) with a mean age of 51.94±13 years, and 51 controls (30 men, 21 women) with a mean age, 49.31±15 years were included in this study in a retrospective fashion. All computed tomographic (CT) images were evaluated by two neuroradiologists. Sclerosis of pterygoid plate and other findings included pterygoid plate erosion, adjacent tumor enhancement, and parapharyngeal extension which were assessed. MRI findings were also recorded. The prevalence of pterygoid plate sclerosis was compared using Chi-square statistical tests. Imaging findings were analyzed by binary logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: The prevalence of pterygoid plate sclerosis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma was 53.9% compared to the control group (16.7%) and the difference was statistically significant (P-value< 0.001). In nasopharyngeal carcinoma, the prevalence of tumor adjacent to the pterygoid plate, parapharyngeal extension and pterygoid plate erosion were 69.6%, 81.4%, 38.2%, respectively. No erosion of pterygoid plate was detected in the control group. The odds of adjacent tumor enhancement and pterygoid plate erosion was 7.29 and 20.56 times higher in the sclerotic pterygoid plate (p-values of 0.019 and 0.000, respectively). MRI was available for four nasopharyngeal carcinoma cases with five sclerotic pterygoid plates, where two showed enhancements. All non-sclerotic pterygoid plates showed no enhancement on MRI. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of sclerotic pterygoid plate is significantly higher in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma with a considerably higher chance of adjacent tumor enhancement and pterygoid plate erosion.",2022,"Boonrod, Arunnit; Phuttharak, Warinthorn; Ounjaroen, Natta",Asian Pac J Cancer Prev
WHO,COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on dental students: A multi-institutional survey,"PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: To investigate dental students' perceptions and concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, their coping strategies and support resources, and their perceived stress levels. METHODS: A customized 19-item survey and the perceived stress scale (PSS) were applied to undergraduate dental students from the US, Spain, Ireland, Chile, India, and Brazil between April 10 and July 5, 2020. Linear modeling and mediation analysis were used to explore the relationships among demographics, stressors, coping mechanisms, social support, and stress RESULTS: A total of 4475 students responded to the survey. The majority (72.4%) were women, and 52.3% had no COVID-19 training at the time of the survey. The students reported that they had to accommodate to changes in patient care (96.6%) and didactic learning (95.2%) activities, while 88.5% of the respondents indicated at least one of their courses moved online. Transition to online courses went ""smoothly with some troubles"" for 51.8% of the respondents, and 48.3% perceived the faculty as prepared for the online transition; however, 45.9% reported feeling extremely concerned about the impact of COVID-19 on their education. The average PSS score was 21.9 of 40 (moderate stress). Multivariate models were built for participants with full data (n = 3899). Being male, having completed more dental coursework, and perceiving a smoother transition were associated with lower PSS scores; more concern about academic progress was associated with higher PSS.

Decisions will be based on high-level evidence, supported by real-time digitized data collection, data analysis, incorporated into artificial-intelligence systems. To reach this goal, EBMT/JACIE will be challenged to start the process by further fostering harmonization within and between organizations at institutional, national, and European levels.

Medline; WHO,Lactococcus lactis-fermented spinach juice suppresses LPS-induced expression of adhesion molecules and inflammatory cytokines through the NF-κB pathway in HUVECs,"Spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.), a green leafy vegetable, is widely regarded as a functional food due to its biological activities; however, to the best of our knowledge, there are no previous studies that have investigated the protective effects of fermented spinach against endothelial dysfunction and its underlying mechanisms. Therefore, this study investigated the effects and possible mechanisms of action of fresh spinach juice (S.juice) and fermented S.juice on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammatory responses in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). The HUVECs were treated with S.juice and fermented S.juice for 18 h before LPS exposure, and the levels of cytokines and chemokines, such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) and interleukin-6 (IL-6), were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). Furthermore, to examine the changes in inflammatory responses to the two treatments, immunofluorescence analysis was used to visualize the nuclear translocation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Western blot analysis was also performed to detect the differences in the expression of endothelial cell adhesion molecules, specifically vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). Both S.juice and fermented S.juice inhibited the LPS-induced expression of MCP-1 and IL-6, and suppressed VCAM-1 and ICAM-1. Additionally, fermented S.juice inhibited the LPS-induced activation of NF-κB and degradation of the inhibitor of NF-κB (IκBα) in an LPS dose-dependent manner. These results suggest that the anti-inflammatory effect of vitamin K2-enriched fermented S.juice is mediated by the suppression of the NF-κB pathway, suggesting its potential as a novel therapeutic candidate for inflammatory cardiovascular disease.",2022,"Lee, Sang-Hee; Han, Ah-Ram; Kim, Byoung-Mok; Jeong Sung, Mi; Hong, Sun-Mee",Exp Ther Med

Typically, however, neuroscientific paradigms lack the reciprocal to-and-fro characteristic of social communication, offering little insight into the way these processes operate online during real-world interaction. In the present study, we overcame this by developing a ""hyperscanning"" paradigm in which pairs of interactants could communicate verbally with one another in a joint-action task whilst both undergoing functional magnetic resonance imaging simultaneously. Successful performance on this task required both interlocutors to predict their partner's upcoming utterance in order to converge on the same word as each other over recursive exchanges, based only on one another's prior verbal expressions. By applying various levels of analysis to behavioural and neuroimaging data acquired from 20 dyads, three principle findings emerged: First, interlocutors converged frequently within the same semantic space, suggesting that mutual understanding had been established. Second, assessing the brain responses of each interlocutor as they planned their upcoming utterances on the basis of their co-player's previous word revealed the engagement of the temporo-parietal junctional (TPJ), precuneus and dorso-lateral pre-frontal cortex. Moreover, responses in the precuneus were modulated positively by the degree of semantic convergence achieved on each round. Second, effective connectivity among these regions indicates the crucial role of the right TPJ in this process, consistent with the Nexus model. Third, neural signals within certain nodes of this network became aligned between interacting interlocutors. We suggest this reflects an interpersonal neural process through which interactants infer and align to one another's intentional states whilst they establish a common ground.",2020-12-29,"Salazar, M; Shaw, D J; Gajdoš, M; Mareček, R; Czekóová, K; Mikl, M; Brázdil, M",NeuroImage
Medline; PMC,Portals of Change: How Patient Portals Will Ultimately Work for Safety Net Populations,"Despite the implementation of internet patient portals into the safety net after the introduction of the Affordable Care Act in the United States, little attention has been paid to the process of engaging vulnerable patients into these portals. The portal is a health technology tool that was developed with a mainstream, English-speaking audience in mind. Thus, there are valid concerns that such technologies will actually exacerbate health care disparities, conferring further advantages to the already advantaged. In this paper, we describe a framework for portal engagement (awareness, registration, and use) among safety net patients. We incorporate the experiences in the Los Angeles County Department of Health Services to illustrate important contextual factors for portal outreach in our safety net. Finally, we discuss considerations for moving forward with health technology in the safety net as the next version of patient portals are being developed.",2020-10-23,"Casillas, Alejandra; Abhat, Anshu; Mahajan, Anish; Moreno, Gerardo; Brown, Arleen F; Simmons, Sara; Szilagyi, Peter",J Med Internet Res
ArXiv,Evaluating the root causes of fatigue and associated risk factors in the Brazilian regular aviation industry,"This work evaluates the potential root causes of fatigue using a biomathematical model and a robust sample of aircrew rosters from the Brazilian regular aviation. The fatigue outcomes derive from the software Sleep, Activity, Fatigue, and Task Effectiveness Fatigue Avoidance Scheduling Tool (SAFTE-FAST). The average minimum SAFTE-FAST effectiveness during critical phases of flight decreases cubically with the number of shifts that elapse totally or partially between mid-night and 6 a.m. within a 30-day period ($N_{NS}$). As a consequence, the relative fatigue risk increases by 23.3% (95% CI, 20.4-26.2%) when increasing $N_{NS}$ from 1 to 13. The average maximum equivalent wakefulness in critical phases also increases cubically with the number of night shifts and exceeds 24 hours for rosters with $N_{NS}$ above 10. The average fatigue hazard area in critical phases of flight varies quadratically with the number of departures and landings within 2 and 6 a.m. ($N_{Wocl}$). These findings demonstrate that both $N_{NS}$ and $ N_{Wocl}$ should be considered as key performance indicators and be kept as low as reasonably practical when building aircrew rosters. The effectiveness scores at 30 minute time intervals allowed a model estimate for the relative fatigue risk as a function of the time of the day, whose averaged values show reasonable qualitative agreement with previous measurements of pilot errors. Tailored analyses of the SAFTE-FAST inputs for afternoon naps before night shifts, commuting from home to station and vice-versa, and bedtime before early-start shifts show relevant group effects ($p<0.001$) comparing the groups with and without afternoon naps, with one or two hours of commuting and with or without the advanced bedtime feature of the SAFTE-FAST software, evidencing the need of a better and more accurate understanding of these parameters when modelling fatigue risk factors.",2022-01-14,"Rodrigues, Tulio E.; Fischer, Frida M.; Helene, Otaviano; Antunes, Eduardo; Furlan, Eduardo; Morteo, Eduardo; Menquini, Alfredo; Lisboa, Joao; Frank, Arnaldo; Simoes, Alexandre; Papazian, Karla; Helene, Andr'e F.",
